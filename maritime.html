Culper Spy Ring


Throughout the American Revolution, Long Island Sound was the site of small engagements between the American patriots and the British and their loyalist supporters. There were frequent raids across the Sound, both by patriots from Connecticut and by loyalists from Long Island, and British naval vessels and British and American privateers prowled the Sound's waters, attacking one another and preying on merchant vessels engaged in trade. Many of these local raiders used open rowboats known as whaleboats.<br><br>
Caleb Brewster, a refugee from Long Island living near Fairfield, was the captain of one of these small armed boats. <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/british-burn-fairfield/" target="_blank">Burned by the British</a> in 1779, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/fairfield/" target="_blank">Fairfield</a> was a hub of patriot activity, and many successful raids were launched from its small harbors. Brewster took part in several of these raids and was also a crucial link in George Washington's spy ring, known today as the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/caleb-brewster-and-the-culper-spy-ring/" target="_blank">Culper Ring</a> (from the code name of its chief operative on Long Island).<br><br>
Washington's spies gathered intelligence in British-occupied New York, and often Brewster carried their coded messages across the Sound in his whaleboat. Another Long Island native, Benjamin Tallmadge, who served as Washington's spymaster, received the messages and passed them on to Washington himself.<br><br>
Following the war, Caleb Brewster remained in Connecticut, and his papers now reside in the Fairfield Museum and History Center.<br><br>

West Indies Trade


In the years before the American Revolution, Connecticut merchants grew rich on the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticut-and-the-west-indies-trade/" target="_blank">West Indies trade</a>, shipping cattle, horses, and produce to supply the plantations of Jamaica, Barbados, and other Caribbean islands, and returning loaded with sugar, molasses, and rum. As a result, successful ship owners such as Richard Alsop, Gurdon Saltonstall, and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/jeremiah-wadsworth/" target="_blank">Jeremiah Wadsworth</a> built stately mansions in towns along the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a> and Long Island Sound.<br><br>
The West Indies trade was one lap of the notorious triangle trade, which imported slaves from Africa to work the sugar plantations of the Caribbean. While most of the small Connecticut vessels plied back and forth between New England and the West Indian islands, a few also made voyages to Africa, engaging directly in the slave trade. Some Connecticut merchants even owned small numbers of slaves, which were offered for sale in towns such as <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a> and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/middletown/" target="_blank">Middletown.</a><br><br>
The homes of Richard Alsop in Middletown, Gurdon Saltonstall in New London, and Jeremiah Wadsworth in Hartford are long gone, but the houses of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-silas-deane-american-patriot/" target="_blank">Silas Deane</a> and Joseph Webb (who were both successful merchants in the West Indies trade before becoming involved in the American Revolution) still survive in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wethersfield/" target="_blank">Wethersfield</a>. In addition, numerous objects and resources related to Connecticut's maritime history and trade with the West Indies can be found in the collections of the New Haven Museum.<br><br>

Connecticut River


Connecticut takes its name from the long tidal river that runs from northern New England through the center of the state and down into Long Island Sound. "Quinnehtukqut" is a <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/mohegan-federal-recognition/" target="_blank">Mohegan word</a>, and long before the arrival of European settlers, Native Americans plied the river in their canoes and farmed the rich meadows along the riverbanks.<br><br>
The earliest European settlements (<a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a>, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/windsor/" target="_blank">Windsor</a> and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wethersfield/" target="_blank">Wethersfield</a>) established themselves along the river as overland travel proved difficult. Soon vessels sailing from river ports provided settlers with access to towns and cities along the coast and to their homeland across the Atlantic.<br><br>
During the nineteenth century, steamboats and wooden sailing vessels carried freight up and down the river. Steamboats also took passengers to such places as the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/goodspeed-opera-house-opens-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Goodspeed Opera House</a> in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/east-haddam/" target="_blank">East Haddam</a>, on excursions along Long Island Sound, and on longer voyages to New York, Providence, and beyond. This traffic continued into the twentieth century, but the river's narrow channel and the shifting sandbars at its mouth made it difficult to navigate, especially for the larger ships constructed during the nineteenth century.<br><br>
As the first railroads and, later, the interstate highway system provided alternate means of transportation, the importance of the river for commerce diminished. Regular passenger service ended in 1939, when the steamboat Hartford made her last run to New York City.<br><br>
The river remains popular with recreational boaters today. To learn more about the river's role in Connecticut's history, visit the Connecticut River Museum, housed in a former steamboat dock in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/essex/" target="_blank">Essex</a>.<br><br>

Submarines


America's first submarine was invented by <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/david-bushnell-and-his-revolutionary-submarine/" target="_blank">David Bushnell</a> of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/westbrook/" target="_blank">Westbrook</a>, Connecticut, while he was a student at <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/yale-university-from-colonial-times-to-the-present/" target="_blank">Yale</a>. In 1776, during the American Revolution, Bushnell's Turtle, a one-man submersible propelled largely by a hand-crank, was employed in an <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-turtle-submarine-today-in-history/" target="_blank">unsuccessful attempt</a> to blow up a British warship in New York Harbor. (A model of David Bushnell's Turtle may be viewed at the Connecticut River Museum in Essex.)<br><br>
More than a century later, Connecticut found itself at the forefront of submarine technology and production. Simon Lake began building submarines in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/bridgeport/" target="_blank">Bridgeport</a> as early as 1901. His Lake Torpedo Boat Company built submarines until 1924, with many of his vessels used to combat the Germans during <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-i/" target="_blank">World War I</a>.<br><br>
Founded in 1899, The Electric Boat Company of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/groton/" target="_blank">Groton</a> built its first submarines--for the Peruvian navy--in 1924 and began building submarines for the United States in 1931. During <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-ii/"  target="_blank">World War II</a>, Electric Boat built 74 submarines and 398 PT boats for the U.S. Navy.<br><br>
Following the war, Electric Boat built the world's first nuclear submarine, the U.S.S. Nautilus. <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/launching-of-the-uss-nautilus-1954/" target="_blank">Launched in 1954</a>, the Nautilus became the first submarine to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/uss-nautilus-passes-under-the-north-pole/" target="_blank">sail beneath the ice</a> at the North Pole and remained in service until 1980.<br><br>
Electric Boat continues to build submarines for the United States Navy to this day and the U.S.S. Nautilus is permanently docked and may be visited at the U.S.S. Nautilus Memorial and Submarine Force Museum in Groton.<br><br>

Coast Guard


The forerunner of today's Coast Guard, the Revenue Cutter Service, was established in the 1790s to enforce tariffs and trade laws. During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a>, the revenue cutter Eagle patrolled Long Island Sound from her base in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a> looking for British merchant ships and American vessels carrying illegal British goods. Revenue cutters also combatted the slave trade and, later, the Coast Guard intercepted rumrunners, enforced prohibition, and protected Long Island Sound during two world wars.<br><br>
The School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service came to Connecticut in 1910, when it moved to Fort Trumbull in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a>. Its name changed to the Coast Guard Academy in 1915 when the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the Life Saving Service. Later, the Coast Guard took over the duties of the Lighthouse Board and assumed responsibility for lighthouses and lightships. In 1932, the Academy moved from Fort Trumbull to a new forty-acre campus overlooking the Thames River.<br><br>
Today the Coast Guard maintains stations in New London and New Haven and is responsible for search and rescue, maritime law enforcement, military readiness, and port security, maintaining two permanent security zones along the Thames River protecting the Electric Boat Corporation and the state's naval submarine base.<br><br>

Whaling


Connecticut fishermen captured whales in the waters off Long Island as early as the seventeenth century, rendering blubber to produce whale oil for lighting and machine lubrication. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, whaling became big business, and specialized whale ships made longer and longer voyages in quest of their quarry.<br><br>
By the early nineteenth century, Connecticut whalers regularly visited the Arctic, Antarctic, and South Pacific, where large numbers of whales could still be found. The demand for whale oil peaked in the mid-nineteenth century. This period also witnessed the application of whalebone (from baleine whales such as the right whale and the humpback whale) in the manufacture of women's corsets, hoop skirts, and parasols, as well as a demand for ambergris (from sperm whales) for use in products such as perfumes.<br><br>
While <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a> earned the nickname "The Whaling City" and was one of busiest whaling ports in America, whaleships sailed from other Connecticut ports as well, and sailors from all over the state took part in whaling voyages. In addition, whale oil merchants and captains built magnificent homes on the wealth the industry provided. Two of the Greek revival mansions on Whale Oil Row--Huntington Street--in New London belonged to Thomas W. Williams and Enoch Stoddard, whaleship owners who made their fortunes in the trade.<br><br>
Whaling businesses declined in the late nineteenth century due to the rise of the petroleum industry (and changes in women's fashions) and soon abandoned and derelict whale ships became a common sight in Connecticut harbors.<br><br>

Commerce


Connecticut's early settlers relied on imports of manufactured goods from Europe, while exports of raw materials from the colony were an important source of revenue. In the 1700s, merchants such as Joseph Webb of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wethersfield/" target="_blank">Wethersfield</a> and Nathaniel Shaw of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a> grew rich trading with the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticut-and-the-west-indies-trade/" target="_blank">West Indies</a>. Later merchants like Samuel Russell of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/middletown/" target="_blank">Middletown</a> and Jeremiah Wadsworth of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a> made fortunes in the China trade.<br><br>
John Griswold of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/old-lyme/" target="_blank">Old Lyme</a> founded the Black X Line, one of the first packet lines to provide regular scheduled service from New York to London. Griswold's cousin, Robert Harper Griswold, would become one of the line's most famous captains.<br><br>
By the mid-1800s, steamboats carried passengers and freight up and down the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a> and along Long Island Sound, connecting with railroad lines in New London, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/norwich/" target="_blank">Norwich</a>, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a>, and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/bridgeport/" target="_blank">Bridgeport</a>. Docks in these ports were busy places, where goods were transferred from ships to waiting railroad cars, and passengers disembarking from steamboats rushed to catch departing trains.<br><br>
Although commercial traffic at Connecticut's ports declined in the 1900s, New Haven remains the busiest port between Boston and New York City. New London and Bridgeport also remain active ports, with ferries carrying both passengers and freight to Long Island and other offshore islands, just as they have done for centuries.<br><br>

Lighthouses


The waters of Long Island Sound are treacherous. Prior to the invention of radar, sonar, and GPS, those navigating the sound relied on physical aids such as lighthouses to provide safety.<br><br>
The first lighthouse in Connecticut was erected at the entrance to New London Harbor in 1760. That lighthouse proved inadequate, however, and in 1801 authorities replaced it with the 89-foot octagonal tower that still survives today.<br><br>
Among Connecticut's other surviving early lighthouses are Faulkner Island Light (1802) off Guilford, Lynde Point Light (1803) at the mouth of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a> in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/old-saybrook-2/" target="_blank">Old Saybrook</a>, and Five Mile Point Light (1805) in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven.</a><br><br>
Throughout the nineteenth century, Connecticut continued to construct additional lighthouses along its shores, many of them on small islands such as Sheffield Island (1868) off <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/norwalk/" target="_blank">Norwalk,</a> and reefs such as Penfield Reef Light (1874) off <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/milford/" target="_blank">Milford.</a> All of these lighthouses remained in service well into the twentieth century, and some, such as Stratford Point Light (1881), incorporate charming and substantial keepers' houses, where the lighthouse keepers lived with their families.<br><br>
Today, a number of Connecticut lighthouse tours are offered to the public (usually during the summer months). One of these is offered by the Custom House Maritime Museum in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a>, which provides tours of New London Harbor Light and boat trips to New London Ledge Light.<br><br>

Shipyards


During colonial times, many small shipyards located themselves along the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a> from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/old-saybrook-2/" target="_blank">Saybrook</a> to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/windsor/" target="_blank">Windsor</a> and all along Long Island Sound. Sailing vessels such as sloops and schooners were built in places like <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/rocky-hill/" target="_blank">Rocky Hill</a> and Dutch Point in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a> as well as in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/fairfield/" target="_blank">Fairfield</a>, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/guilford/" target="_blank">Guilford</a>, and scores of other towns.<br><br>
The Dauntless Shipyard in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/essex/" target="_blank">Essex</a> and the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-gildersleeve-shipbuilding-legacy-in-portland/" target="_blank">Gildersleeve</a> Shipyard in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/portland/" target="_blank">Portland</a> continued building wooden sailing vessels well into the twentieth century. As technology advanced, however, many Connecticut shipyards began manufacturing steamboats. George Greenman & Company in Mystic, known for building clipper ships, began building steam gunboats for the Union navy during the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/civil-war/" target="_blank">Civil War</a>. William Henry Goodspeed's shipyard in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/east-haddam/" target="_blank">East Haddam</a> likewise built both sailing vessels and steamboats, including thirteen Civil War gunboats.<br><br>
Richard Peck of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a> and the Palmer Shipyard in Noank built large steamboats for the steamship companies that provided transportation up and down the eastern seaboard and beyond. Simon Lake's Torpedo Boat Company in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/bridgeport/" target="_blank">Bridgeport</a> built submarines for the navy during <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-i/" target="_blank">World War I</a> and the Electric Boat Company in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/groton/" target="_blank">Groton</a> built submarines and PT boats during <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-ii/" target="_blank">World War II</a> and nuclear submarines during the Cold War.<br><br>
Today Electric Boat continues to produce submarines for the navy, while the Henry B. Dupont Preservation Shipyard at Mystic Seaport preserves the shipbuilding technology of an earlier age, performing restoration work on historic vessels such as the Seaport's own Charles W. Morgan and replicas such as the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-amistad/" target="_blank">Amistad</a> and Mayflower II.<br><br>

Exploration


Although no formal exploring expeditions ever launched from Connecticut, history is full of Connecticut men who risked their lives exploring the seas. <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/john-ledyard-connecticuts-most-famous-traveler/" target="_blank">John Ledyard</a>, for example, served as a marine on British Captain James Cook's third and final voyage from 1776 to 1780, visiting the Pacific Northwest, the Hawaiian Islands, and New Zealand.<br><br>
Some fifty years later, during the first United States Exploring Expedition, a young Yale geologist, James Dwight Dana, served as the expedition's mineralogist. His name was given to Dana Passage in Puget Sound and Mount Dana in Alaska.<br><br>
Connecticut seamen in search of whales and seals ventured far into the Arctic and Antarctic. In 1820, for example, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/nathaniel-palmer-discovers-antarctica-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Nathanial Palmer</a> of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/stonington/" target="_blank">Stonington</a>, captain of the sloop Hero, sailed from the South Shetland Islands looking for seals and became one of the first people to sight the Antarctic continent. Palmer Land, a part of the Antarctic Peninsula and the Palmer Archipelago are both named after him. Hero Bay (on Livingston Island in the South Shetlands) is named after his sloop. The mansion Palmer subsequently built in 1852-54 is operated today as a house museum by the Stonington Historical Society.<br><br>
