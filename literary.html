She was often ill as a teenager and did not finish high school, but when the male teachers at the local school were called to serve in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-i/" target="_blank">World War I</a>, she was asked to fill in teaching first grade and stayed. She taught for thirty-two years before retiring to write. While The Boxcar Children is her most acclaimed work, she wrote many other books and articles for both adults and children.<br><br>After Warner's death in 1979, she was laid to her rest in the Grove Street Cemetery in Putnam. Her publisher, Albert Whitman & Company, subsequently assumed the rights to the Boxcar Children and the series now includes over 150 titles.<br><br>The <a href="http://aspinockhs-putnam.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Aspinock Historical Society</a> of Putnam acquired an authentic 1920s boxcar and opened the Gertrude Chandler Warner Boxcar Children Museum in 2004.

Noah Webster House

Noah Webster is known best for writing the first American dictionary, <i>A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language</i>, and for the subsequent dictionary which took him twenty-eight years to complete, <i>An American Dictionary of the English Language</i>. The second edition of the dictionary, printed in 1840, contained over 70,000 words, about 12,000 of which had never appeared in another dictionary.<br><br>Born in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/west-hartford/" target="_blank">West Hartford</a> in 1758, Webster attended <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/yale-university-from-colonial-times-to-the-present/" target="_blank">Yale</a> at the age of fifteen. His collegiate years were interrupted by the American Revolution and he served briefly in the Connecticut militia before returning to Yale and graduating in 1778.<br><br>Unable to afford law school, Webster became a teacher and was dismayed by the use of textbooks from England which pledged allegiance to King George III and contained only traditional English spellings of words that had since been Americanized (such as "colour" instead of the Americanized "color"). In 1782 he <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/noah-webster-and-the-dream-of-a-common-language/" target="_blank">published his own textbook</a>, <i>A Grammatical Institute of the English Language</i>, popularly referred to, because of its blue cover, as the <i>Blue-Backed Speller</i>.<br><br>In addition to being a prolific writer, Webster practiced law, was one of the founders of Amherst College, served in the Massachusetts legislature, and started New York City's first daily newspaper, <i>American Minerva</i>.<br><br>After Webster's death in 1843, the 1841 edition of his dictionary was acquired by George and Charles Merriam and they secured the rights to publish future editions.
