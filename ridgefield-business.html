Ridgefield - The Butcher, Baker, and Candlestick Maker<br><br>

Orientation<br><br>
What businesses comprised a town years ago? Ridgefield has a long history as a booming place of trade and commerce. This walking tour explores early enterprise and tells the intriguing stories behind Ridgefield's early shops and factories, the people who ran them, and how the town prospered.


The Land of Plenty (550 Main Street)<br><br>

The smell of success! The Stebbins homestead was built by Benjamin Stebbins, a prominent Ridgefielder who was born in Deerfield, Franklin County, Massachusetts, in 1692. At the tender age of nine, he lost his immediate family during the Deerfield Massacre and was raised by cousins who apprenticed him in the tanner trade. In exchange for his invaluable leatherworking services, the town of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> granted him one of the earliest home lots at the northern end of Main Street.<br><br>Tanners were very important to early colonial communities, providing a means to convert stripped animal hide into valuable leather that could be used for saddles, bags, shoes, and other necessary items. Though tanning was profitable work, the process created smelly fumes that the proprietors wanted to keep as far away from the center of town as possible. Therefore, his granted land was an unfavorable property. Heavily forested with jutting cuts of rockface and littered with stone, Benjamin had to work the land for almost two decades to transform it into the finest residence in all of colonial Ridgefield.<br><br>By 1746, the tax list showed Benjamin Stebbins to be the town's wealthiest resident. He became one of Ridgefield's most politically active early citizens, who was elected Town Selectman five times and represented Ridgefield in the colonial legislature. During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/battle-at-ridgefield-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Battle of Ridgefield</a>, the homestead served as a field hospital for both sides, and Benjamin refused to leave his house despite combat peppering it with musket balls and setting it alight several times!

Man of His Word (470 Main Street)<br><br>

From Small Seeds Grow Mighty Trees! This area of town became the home of many a <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> entrepreneur, including Richard W. Osborn, responsible for running the I. Osborn & Co. lumber and coal business.<br><br>Born in the Bennett's Farms District in 1850, Mr. Osborn founded the company in the 1880s, which has survived to become the Ridgefield Supply Company, still in profitable operation today and the oldest continuously operated retail business in town. The lumberyard moved to 29 Prospect Street and delivered all kinds of pine and hardwood lumber, shingles, timber, and lath to the people of Ridgefield.<br><br>Osborn's contributions to the town extended far past his lumber business however, he was also an excellent orator and community organizer. The Ridgefield Press described him as being "small of stature but with a voice of a giant." A well-read man, Osborn was a member of the Ridgefield Library board of directors, president of the Methodist Episcopal Church board of trustees, director of the Ridgefield Savings Bank (after its operations were moved out of the Old Hundred building) and later became its president in 1932, though he unfortunately died the following year. Along with all that he was a registrar of voters, a burgess, and borough clerk. With a schedule like that, having a residence right in town was certainly a good choice!

<br><br>

Still Standing (444 Main Street)<br><br>

Leave your cash at home and get ready to barter! While this area is primarily shops and offices today, this was once the site of the Old Indian Trading Post, affectionately referred to as "Tuppence," for the two pence that would have been paid for goods.<br><br>This trading post was built in 1710, years before the town was a desirable place to live, and decades before settlers took up arms against the crown. "Tuppence" was a center for trade between colonists and the Ramapoo Tribe, led by Chief Catoonah.<br><br>In September of 1708, Chief Catoonah sold 20,000 acres of the land that would become <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> for 100 pounds sterling. In its untouched state, the tract was described as "forests filled with game, and streams and lakes teeming with fish, with wooded hillsides and sheltered valleys."<br><br>For a while the two groups lived peacefully, with "Tuppence" serving as a hub for an exchange of goods like fish and furs for bladed metalwork and guns. Before too long, expansionist pressure from the settlers forced the Ramapoo to move their village westward into present-day Westchester, naming the town of Katonah, NY, after their chief.<br><br>The trading post was later adapted into a general store. In 1948, Mrs. Mary Olcott moved the building to its current location south of the fountain at 35 Main Street, where it has been restored into a private residence. It is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Ridgefield.

<br><br>

From Spark to Flame (404 Main Street)<br><br>

If you're on the market to buy a new chair or embalm a loved one, you've come to the right place! As uncanny a combination as this may seem, Bedient and Mead Furniture and Undertaking was one of the businesses run out of the Gage Block. That is, until it burst into flames on Sunday, December 8, 1895, starting the Great Fire of Ridgefield.<br><br>When the fire broke out, Dr. Willis E. Weed rushed to notify D. Frank Bedient, a partner in the business. With no formal fire department in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>, responsibility for halting the spread of the fire fell squarely in the property owners' hands. With the help of other townspeople, Bedient climbed a ladder to the second story of the building and formed the tip of a bucket brigade reaching all the way to the nearest water source. Despite their valiant efforts, the Gage Block, along with a majority of Main Street, was beyond saving.<br><br>The fire, destructive as it was, proved a blessing in disguise for commerce in Ridgefield. The country was rapidly modernizing, and the fire presented something of a clean slate. Mr. Bedient bought out his partner and rebuilt the store. This optimization was reflected in the rest of the town, with old wooden rubble being replaced with new industrial brick structures. In 1897, the town's first fire department was organized, followed by the establishment of a more advanced water system in 1902.

<br><br>

Money Talks (400 Main Street)<br><br>

Every center of commerce needs a place to keep its businesses' hard-earned cash! In 1871, the Ridgefield Saving Bank was established in Bailey and Gage's Old Hundred shop, an indication of the town's substantial growth. Its first meeting was a veritable who's who of the town, electing Dr. Daniel L. Adams (a founding father of baseball) as president, Louis H. Bailey as treasurer, and Francis A. Rockwell as a director. Later, in 1900, out of the ashes of the Great Fire, a new Town Hall was built on Main Street. It housed the Ridgefield Savings Bank until 1922 when a stone structure was erected that boasted a security system unmatched by any other bank in all of Connecticut.<br><br>Mr. Bailey made a considerable effort to put money in the pockets of the people of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>. In addition to his role in founding the Ridgefield Savings Bank, Bailey was responsible for his eponymous Avenue, built to grant easier access to the railroad through town and push business. During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/civil-war/" target="_blank">American Civil War</a>, Bailey even had a hand in mustering the men of Ridgefield to preserve the Union. He founded a committee that guaranteed a generous bounty to townsmen for their military service against the Confederates, whether they volunteered right away, after the war had raged for some time, or even in the event that a draft order was issued. Above all, Bailey was committed to keeping commerce in Ridgefield alive and well.

Dress for Success (6 Catoonah Street)<br><br>

"Much that is beautiful and noble in Ridgefield's history was inspired in her little one-room school houses," states George Rockwell in his book, <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheHistoryOfRidgefieldConnecticut/page/n7" target="_blank"><i>The History of Ridgefield, Connecticut</i></a>. As early as 1721, a resolution was passed at a town meeting prioritizing education with the decree that "eight pounds shall be raised for ye support of a school." The investment the settlers made paid off in spades as <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> has produced many learned people who went on to great things. A few of note are brothers Phineas and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lounsbury-elected-governor-today-in-history-january-4-2/" target="_blank">George Lounsbury</a>, who both served as governors of Connecticut; Samuel Goodrich, Jr., alias <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/peter-parley-schoolhouse/" target="_blank">Peter Parley</a>, an esteemed author who wrote about his experiences as a student of the West Lane Schoolhouse; and the successful entrepreneurial team of D. Smith Sholes and Edward H. Smith, owners of The Ridgefield Shirt Factory.<br><br>Anything but a stuffed shirt! The Sholes and Smith Shirt Factory opened in the 1870s with the claim that their products would "give you Fits' in Shirts!" The shirt manufactory was famous for the "Ridgefield Shirt," an impossibly comfortable garment whose cut was "a pleasure to wear" compared to the stiffly starched shirts of the day. The business employed as many as sixty people at a time and was so prosperous that it had numerous locations around town including on the site of the present Fire House, the old Corner Store, and in a section of the Big Shop. The factory's specialty was producing shirts in an array of colors and their products were very popular in New York City.

<br><br>

A Reversal of Fortune (22 Catoonah Street)<br><br>

Make sure you're on the correct street! The town's first blacksmith, Benjamin Burt, originally from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/norwalk/" target="_blank">Norwalk</a>, came to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> in 1712 and was granted Lot #28 (specifically reserved for a smithy) by the town's proprietors. The agreement was Burt needed to serve in this position for a term of four years in order to gain full possession of the land.<br><br>Being the first and only blacksmith, Burt was highly esteemed within the community, second only to the town's minister, and his mastery of the metal arts included the highest quality tools, weapons, and everyday items such as kettles, nails, and door hinges. As his prominence grew, he quickly accumulated several other properties throughout Ridgefield, including a sawmill under Copps Mountain by the 1730s and a gristmill at Lake Mamanasco (which was likely the main wheat- and corn-grinding mill in town) in 1742.<br><br>Later, the Burt family's reputation took a drastic turn when, during the American Revolution, it was revealed that some members supported the British Crown. As a result, the family lost their property, which was confiscated by the government and sold at public auction. Burt's Lane, originally named for the blacksmith and one of the earliest recorded roads with a person's name, was changed to Catoonah Street in honor of the chief of the Ramapoo tribe. One of his other parcels of land still retains the name Blacksmith Ridge today.

<br><br>

Crack the Whip! (23 Catoonah Street)<br><br>

More than a one-trick pony! Whitlock's Livery (later known as Sperry Livery stable) was operated by the colorful Henry B. Whitlock who, as a 12-year-old boy circa 1838, accomplished the extraordinary feat of driving four horses from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/danbury/" target="_blank">Danbury</a> to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/norwalk/" target="_blank">Norwalk</a> and back on his own!<br><br>Henry drove a stagecoach to the Branchville train station before the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> one was built in 1870 and carried the mail. Later when the station opened, the stage was used to shuttle passengers, particularly wealthy New Yorkers who had summer homes in Ridgefield. As an expert horse handler, Henry was hired by Barnum and Bailey's Circus as a driver. His claim to fame was the ability to turn around a circus wagon pulled by 16 pairs of horses on Main Street. He was such a crackerjack with a whip that it was reported he could strike a fly off his horse's ear undisturbed.<br><br>In addition to the stagecoach, the livery boarded horses, including those used by the fire department. The business was passed down to Whitlock's son Morris, also a notable horseman.<br><br>Eventually the livery was purchased by B. E. "Burt" Sperry who moved to Ridgefield in 1892. Sperry's Livery stable held up to seventy-five horses for rent or board and also let horses and carriages needed for transportation. The building had a calamitous and unnerving end when in the winter of 1948, the building inspector condemned it and ordered the last tenants to vacate the premises. Hours later, the building was brought down under the weight of snow and the crash was deafening!

<br><br>

Candles and Clasps (19 Catoonah Street)<br><br>

Looking for something to light up your home? Rockwell Candlestick Factory has it all! This successful factory was owned by shoemaker Uriah Seymour until Thomas Rockwell purchased it in 1799. The Candlestick Factory was then passed down from Thomas to his sons, John W. and the particularly talented Francis A., who was known for his green thumb. The brothers formed a partnership and expanded the company by improving upon existing products such as brass and tin candlesticks and hog scrapers--a tool used to prepare the hide of pigs after butchering.<br><br>In addition to the Candlestick Factory, the Rockwells owned a hat manufactory, a harness shop, and a livery stable. In 1850, the United States Patent Office cited Francis Rockwell as making "Improvements in Candlesticks" as well as the inventor of a bedclothes clasp (in the collection of the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/" target="_blank">Ridgefield Historical Society</a>). Francis described the clasp as "a new and Convenient Mode of Clasping or Fastening Bed-Covering to Bedsteads in Common Use, so as to prevent persons, either children or adults, and particularly sick persons, from unintentionally uncovering themselves and liability of taking cold."<br><br>The patent application was submitted by John W., his brother's assignee, and was witnessed by Hiram K. Scott. Many years later, an unnamed item was pictured in a newspaper, under the trivia section "WhatsIt?" The obscure object was a brass hand clasp, patented by one Francis A. Rockwell of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>.

<br><br>

One Stop Shop (378 Main Street)<br><br>

Feeling a bit under the weather? Visit Ridgefield's first Variety and Drug Store! The shop opened in 1853 and was owned by Colonel Hiram Keeler Scott, an active community member who contributed to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> in many ways. In addition to owning the Variety and Drug Store, he served as the postmaster for twenty-eight years, the town clerk for thirty-seven years, a probate judge for thirty-nine years, and a licensed druggist for over fifty years.<br><br>Scott was also busy in his personal life. He married three times and his second wife, Lizzie Maude Gortham, was a favorite subject in his diaries for often being ill. He also diligently recorded in his journals (archived at the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/" target="_blank">Ridgefield Historical Society</a>) daily weather, meetings, and events for the years 1871, 1876, and 1890.<br><br>Scott's drug store filled prescriptions for people and animals, sold everything from fine groceries to hardware to stationery, and was home to the town's post office. In the period following the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/civil-war/" target="_blank">Civil War</a>, he famously installed Ridgefield's first soda fountain, from which he dispensed root beer in stoneware bottles. Scott sold his shop to Harvey P. Bissell in 1895, about four months before the Great Fire, which destroyed it. Bissell rebuilt the shop the following year, and named it "Bissell's Pharmacy," which still exists today, the business having survived yet another devastating fire in 2005.

<br><br>

Risky Business (304 Main Street)<br><br>

All meat lovers head down to the S. S. Hurlbutt Meat Market! This butcher shop gave <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>'s Market Street its name and stood behind the Hurlbutt family's home on Main Street. The owner and founder, David Hurlbutt, started out as a trainee hatter but eventually became a butcher. He bought a piece of property from a close friend, Joshua I. King, and established the meat market in the first half of the nineteenth century. In addition, Hurlbutt initiated a local ice business (along with Mr. King and other partners) by damming up a brook on the easterly side of Market Street and cutting ice from its flooding.<br><br>Unfortunately, David met an untimely death when on November 20, 1858, he was gored in the head by a resistant bull, likely at the site of one of the many farms he traveled to for slaughter. However, even before his death, the market had been taken over by his son, Sereno Stuart Hurlbutt, who expanded it to include a slaughterhouse. Over the years, Sereno was a partner in the carriage manufactory and became a clerk in the Rockwell Candlestick Factory. He was the first Treasurer of the Pilgrim Lodge, Independent Order of Odd Fellows (instituted in 1847); a four-crook trumpeter in the Ridgefield Band (one of the town's oldest institutions, organized in 1838); and the town's Collector of Taxes from 1885 until his death in 1904.

<br><br>

Changing Partners (258 Main Street)<br><br>

It's been given many names but we know it as the eminent Old Hundred! This important structure was built on Lot No. 6 of the town's original proprietor's map. It was acquired by one of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>'s most prominent residents, Lieutenant Joshua King, who began his military career at the age of seventeen.<br><br>When the American Revolution had come to a victorious end, Lt. King and his fellow officer Lt. James Dole, both retired to Ridgefield and transformed this structure into the King & Dole mercantile shop in 1783. However, in 1805 Dole left the business, allowing William Hawley to step in for the next thirty-five years, changing the name to King & Hawley.<br><br>After King died in 1840, Lewis H. Bailey became Hawley's partner, and the mercantile was again renamed Hawley & Bailey. During this time, the store was a popular gathering place to discuss, but never reconcile, local news and national events. The slavery question was a heated topic, and according to Rockwell in <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheHistoryOfRidgefieldConnecticut/page/n7" target="_blank"><i>The History of Ridgefield, Connecticut</i></a>, well-known proponents of the institution included Andrew Jackson, General William Henry Harrison, Henry Clay, and Daniel Webster, who "all had warm supporters, and arguments sometimes waxed hot." Subsequently, D. Smith Gage operated Gage's Mercantile until 1884, at which point the building, in operation for a full century, was given the nickname "Old Hundred."

The Town Prospers (3 Big Shop Lane)<br><br>

Need a ride? Buy the best carriages and wagons in the country at the Big Shop! Blacksmiths, trimmers, upholsterers, harness makers, painters, and woodworkers all came to this carriage manufactory to create the most fashionable form of transportation.<br><br>The ground floor of the Shop was the manufactory for the carriages. Abijah Resseguie's daughter Anna Marie, recollects in her memoir, A View From The Inn, that as a young man her father was apprenticed to carriage maker, John Watrous. Abijah had a knack for this kind of mechanical work and his mind was so inventive that he contributed to the field by creating "labor-saving tools for the trade." In time, he earned an interest in the company which was renamed Resseguie and Olmstead.<br><br>Years later, Abijah was still associated with the firm after he married Anna Keeler and became the proprietor of what is now the <a href="http://www.keelertavernmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Keeler Tavern Museum & History Center</a>. The carriage factory had changed hands again and was now Brush, Olmstead, and Company, the most esteemed product maker in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>, whose light carriages were so popular that their appeal reached south to New Orleans. The Big Shop's second floor was called Jones Hall, and was used for the men of Ridgefield to assemble and discuss business within the town as well as national affairs. In 1864, the vice-president to Abraham Lincoln, Hannibal Hamlin, spoke at a rally there. In 1888, the Big Shop was moved to Bailey Avenue to make way for the new Congregational Church.
