## Ready for Review and Edits (by Jan 21st)

The scope of my work for this project is to migrate existing CTH content to a new web platform. In several pages there are occasionally some old broken links such as this one in [War of 1812](https://jackdougherty.github.io/cth-web-scraping/war-of-1812.html)

... <a href="https://www.eliwhitney.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Eli Whitney Museum and Workshop...

While CTH can update its content at any time on the new map platform, it will be easier for you to review the pages below (and edit any links you wish) prior to when I migrate them after Jan 21st. I can review how to review and edit efficiently during our meeting.

- NOTE: In Coast Guard section, I removed link that pointed back to ConnTours site, and did not replace it:

- ...The School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service came to Connecticut in 1910, when it moved to <a href="https://conntours.oncell.com/en/fort-trumbull-193425.html" target="_blank">Fort Trumbull</a>...

- NOTE: In Fort Trumbull section, I removed link that pointed back to ConnTours site, and did not replace it:

- ...On September 6, 1781, Colonel William Ledyard was in command of both Fort Trumbull and <a href="https://conntours.oncell.com/en/fort-griswold-193426.html" target="_blank">Fort Griswold</a>...

- NOTE: Same issue in Fort Griswold section about Fort Trumbull:

- ...Located at the mouth of the Thames River, on the Groton Heights side of New London Harbor, it proved the perfect compliment to <a href="https://conntours.oncell.com/en/fort-trumbull-193425.html" target="_blank">Fort Trumbull</a>...
