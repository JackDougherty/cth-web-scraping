NOTE: In Coast Guard section, removed link that pointed back to ConnTours site, and did not replace it:

...The School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service came to Connecticut in 1910, when it moved to <a href="https://conntours.oncell.com/en/fort-trumbull-193425.html" target="_blank">Fort Trumbull</a>...

NOTE: In Fort Trumbull section, removed link that pointed back to ConnTours site, and did not replace it:

...On September 6, 1781, Colonel William Ledyard was in command of both Fort Trumbull and <a href="https://conntours.oncell.com/en/fort-griswold-193426.html" target="_blank">Fort Griswold</a>...

NOTE: Same issue in Fort Griswold section about Fort Trumbull:

...Located at the mouth of the Thames River, on the Groton Heights side of New London Harbor, it proved the perfect compliment to <a href="https://conntours.oncell.com/en/fort-trumbull-193425.html" target="_blank">Fort Trumbull</a>,
