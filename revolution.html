Uncovering the Contributions Connecticut Made to the Fight for Independence

Tapping Reeve House and Litchfield Law School
<br><br>
Between 1774 and 1833, Tapping Reeve and his partner, James Gould, educated around one thousand prospective lawyers. Their students went on to become vice presidents (2), United States congressmen (101), United States senators (28), cabinet members (6), justices of the United States Supreme Court (3), governors (14), and chief justices of state supreme courts (13).<br><br>
Tapping Reeve was born in Brookhaven, New York, and attended the College of New Jersey (later Princeton). After living in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a>, he relocated to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/litchfield/" target="_blank">Litchfield</a> in 1772. Two years later took on his first law student, his brother-in-law, Aaron Burr. In addition to Burr, other students who went on to serve the Colonial cause during the American Revolution included Stephen Row Bradley (who commanded a company of Cheshire volunteers) and Oliver Wolcott, Jr. (who later became governor of Connecticut).<br><br>
In the law school's early years, studies took place in Reeve's home and resembled the traditional apprenticeship system, with students studying from Reeve's law library and learning from him as he worked. It was not until later that Reeve established a formal fourteen-month course of study and built the Litchfield Law School building (1784).<br><br>
In the years following the American Revolution, enrollment at the Litchfield Law School surged, reaching its peak attendance in 1813 with 55 students. But the era of independent law schools was drawing to an end. After Reeve retired in 1820, his partner, James Gould, continued to run the school until 1833, when the Litchfield Law School closed its doors.<br><br>

The Roger Home Site
<br><br>
Roger Sherman is the only person to have signed all four "founding documents" of our nation's early history (the Continental Association; the Declaration of Independence; the Articles of Confederation; and the United States Constitution.) Before he became one of the country's hardest-working public servants, however, Sherman lived with his family in a house on the spot where New Milford Town Hall now stands.<br><br>
Sherman's early career had been as a shoemaker and leatherworker, but in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-milford/" target="_blank">New Milford</a> he worked as a surveyor. He also studied law and passed the bar in 1754. The following year he became justice of the peace for Litchfield County and was elected to the Connecticut General Assembly. He gave up these posts shortly after his wife's death in 1760 and moved with his children to New Haven. <br><br>
Sherman settled into life as a merchant and remarried. In 1764 he was again elected to the General Assembly where his reputation of service to the colony got him appointed as one of three Connecticut delegates to the first Continental Congress. In Philadelphia, he worked on the committees that drew up the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation (the new nation's first constitution.) Following the Revolution, he returned from Congress, and in 1784, he was elected the first mayor of the newly incorporated city of New Haven. <br><br>
Sherman then represented Connecticut at the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. With debate over the Constitution raging, Roger Sherman is credited with crafting <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-compromise/" target="_blank"></a>the Great (or Connecticut) Compromise, which led to the two-house legislature that we know today. <br><br>

Putnam Memorial State Park
<br><br>
As the 1778-79 winter quarters for a division of the Continental army during the Revolutionary War, Putnam Memorial State Park is sometimes referred to as "Connecticut's Valley Forge." There soldiers from New Hampshire, Canada, and Connecticut encamped under the command of General Israel Putnam. A Massachusetts native who moved to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/brooklyn/" target="_blank">Brooklyn</a>, Connecticut, Putnam famously gave the order, "Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes," at the Battle of Bunker Hill.<br><br>
Continental troops encamped in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/redding/" target="_blank">Redding</a> in the winter of 1778 because it was believed to be an advantageous position from which to lend support to the defense of West Point, the Long Island coastline, and the town of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/danbury/"target="_blank">Danbury</a> (which had been burned by the British the year before). Three camps were laid out in the area, with the main camp eventually becoming Putnam Memorial State Park. <br><br>
A mountain brook furnished the troops with fresh water, and 116 huts were built along a Â¼-mile-long avenue (Look for the row of collapsed chimneys/firebacks that mark the location.) There was also a blacksmith shop, storage facilities, and officers' quarters. <br><br>
Just like at Valley Forge the winter before, the conditions in Redding were terrible, and the soldiers sent a petition to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/jonathan-trumbull/" target="_blank">Governor Jonathan Trumbull</a> complaining about their poor pay and lack of blankets and clothing. On December 30, 1778, a group of soldiers prepared to march to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a> to protest to the legislature, but Putnam quelled the rebellion after giving a rousing speech and having the plan's ringleader shot. <br><br>
In 1887 Aaron Treadwell donated 12.4 acres of land to the state to create a memorial and preserve the encampment site. Its forty-two-foot granite obelisk was built in 1888.<br><br>

Keeler Tavern Museum
<br><br>
In 1772, Timothy Keeler and his wife, Esther, opened T. Keeler's Inn in what had once been a private home in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>. Keeler's tavern had only served weary travelers and sociable locals for a few years before the town of Ridgefield played host to the only inland battle fought in Connecticut during the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a>.<br><br>
In April 1777, British troops commanded by the governor of New York, Major General William Tryon, sailed to the mouth of the Saugatuck River and marched to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/danbury/" target="_blank">Danbury</a> where they destroyed provisions and munitions being stored for the Continental army. When Brigadier General <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/benedict-arnold/" target="_blank">Benedict Arnold</a> of the Continental army heard of the raid, he anticipated Tryon's return march to Long Island Sound and, along with Brigadier General Gold Selleck Silliman, commander of the militia from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/fairfield/" target="_blank">Fairfield</a>, took up positions en route to Ridgefield with roughly five hundred troops. Simultaneously, General David Wooster hurried to Danbury from New Haven to face Tryon, but arrived too late. While on his way to Ridgefield, Wooster and his army of 200 harassed the British from the rear, when Wooster was shot and killed.<br><br>
Arnold and Silliman set up a barricade made from stones, wagons, earth, and timber at the north end of Ridgefield's broad mile-long "Town Street." Although their force was small, it was well-positioned. The British force, which outnumbered the Patriots three to one, arrived around noon and attacked head-on, while also working their way around the edges of the barricade. The militiamen were soon overwhelmed. As they left victorious, the British troops fired at Timothy Keeler's tavern. One of the cannonballs they used remains lodged in the corner post of the building to this day.<br><br>
Although the Battle of Ridgefield was a victory for the British, it galvanized Connecticut patriots, and it marked the last British attempt to venture inland in Connecticut during the American Revolution.<br><br>

Minute Man Statue
<br><br>
The Minute Man Memorial commemorates the final encounter of the 1777 British incursion into Connecticut. On April 25, 1777, when twenty-six British warships anchored off Connecticut and two thousand British troops under General William Tryon, landed at Compo Beach (then part of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/fairfield/" target=_blank">Fairfield</a>), the local militia was not prepared to mount much resistance. Three days later, however, after the British had raided <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/danbury/" target="_blank">Danbury</a> and were pushing back towards their ships, the local farmers and businessmen who made up the militia met them in battle. Though the British successfully fought their back to their ships, the resistance they met along the way helped dissuade them from venturing deep into Connecticut again.<br><br>
Efforts to create a monument commemorating the Patriot resistance to the British in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/westport/" target="_blank">Westport</a> started around 1903. Six years later, the commission for the statue was awarded to artist Harry Daniel Webster, who modeled the Minute Man in clay in his Westport studio and had it cast in bronze by Tiffany & Co. The Minute Man statue--kneeling, musket at the ready, sleeves pushed up, awaiting the coming British troops--was unveiled on June 17, 1910, the anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill.<br><br>
Years later, on May 6, 1957, the Minute Man statue garnered national attention when it was featured in the final episode of the iconic television program, I Love Lucy. In it, Lucy, who chaired Westport's semi-fictional "Yankee Doodle Day," accidentally shatters the statue moments before its dedication, and then attempts to stand in--literally--for the statue during the ceremony.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-burning-of-danbury/" target="_blank">More</a> on the British Raid of Danbury.<br><br><a href="https://www.westportct.gov/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=5468" target="_blank">More</a> on the Minute Man Memorial.

Defenders Monument
<br><br>
The Defenders' Monument commemorates some 150 Patriots who attempted to ward off a British attack on <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a> at the height of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a>. <br><br>
On the night of July 4, 1779, sentries in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/bridgeport/" target="_blank">Bridgeport</a> gave the alarm that a fleet of British ships had been seen offshore. In New Haven, in the early morning hours of Monday, July 5, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/yale-university-from-colonial-times-to-the-present/" target="_blank">Yale College</a> President <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/ezra-stiles-captured-18th-century-life-on-paper/" target="_blank">Ezra Stiles</a> took up a position with his telescope in the steeple of College Chapel. From there he "clearly saw the boats putting off from the ship and landing a little after sunrise." Some New Haven residents fled, some stayed but took no action, some armed themselves to defend the town, while others armed themselves and went to fight for the British. <br><br>
The landing at New Haven was--in part--a diversionary tactic, intended to lure some of George Washington's troops away from White Plains, New York. By the end of the day, some 2,600 British troops had plundered and destroyed both Patriot and Loyalist property, killing twenty-seven people and fomenting the anger of many previously "undecided" residents.<br><br>
The campaign for establishing the Defenders' Monument was started in 1891 by members of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, who soon joined forces with the Connecticut Sons of the American Revolution. Land for the monument was dedicated in 1896, but it took another fifteen years to raise all of the necessary funds for completion. The final monument, showing three figures (representing a student, farmer, and militiaman) was created by sculptor James E. Kelly and dedicated in 1911.

Joseph Webb House
<br><br>
In May of 1781, toward the end of the American Revolution, General George Washington and French general Count de Rochambeau met at the Joseph Webb House in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wethersfield/" target="_blank">Wethersfield</a> to plan their campaign against the British forces who still occupied much of North America. This meeting has long been touted as the moment that led to the decisive surrender of British forces under General Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown in October of that year, although the winning strategy actually evolved significantly over the course of the months that followed.<br><br>
During his stay in Wethersfield, Washington slept in an upstairs bedroom of the Webb House. The house was built by Joseph Webb Sr. in 1752. Following Webb's death, it was inherited by his oldest son, Joseph Webb Jr. who married Abigail Chester in 1774. It was Joseph Jr. and Abigail who played host to Washington and his staff for the five nights that they spent in Wethersfield. <br><br>
Victims of their lavish lifestyle, the Webbs were ultimately forced to sell the house in 1790 and it passed through a series of owners until, in 1916, it was purchased by antiquarian and photographer <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/past-perfect-wallace-nutting-invents-an-ideal-olde-new-england/" target="_blank">Wallace Nutting</a>. Nutting's restoration of the house included murals in the stairwell and parlors, one of them commemorating the 1781 conference. <br><br>
After Nutting sold the house to the Colonial Dames in 1919, they continued to operate it as a house museum, painting and papering over Nutting's murals. In 2007, the importance of the murals was recognized and they were uncovered and restored. <br><br>

Silas Deane House
<br><br>
The Silas Deane House in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wethersfield/" target="_blank">Wethersfield</a> survives as a monument to an ambitious young man who, despite important contributions to the cause of American liberty during the American Revolution, lost his fortune and reputation due to bitter attacks from his political enemies.<br><br>
Deane was born in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/groton/" target="_blank">Groton</a> in 1737, the son of a blacksmith. Despite humble origins, he attended <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/yale-university-from-colonial-times-to-the-present/" target="_blank">Yale College</a>. After becoming a lawyer, he moved to Wethersfield where he married Mehitable Webb, the widow of merchant Joseph Webb. Following Mehitable's death in 1767, Deane married another rich widow, Elizabeth Saltonstall Evards.<br><br>
Silas Deane was an ardent opponent of the Stamp Act and a delegate to the First Continental Congress. By 1776, he was in France, recruiting French military officers to serve the American cause. Together with Benjamin Franklin, he negotiated the treaties that led to the formal recognition of the United States by the French government and the dispatch of the French troops that helped defeat the British.<br><br>
Despite this impressive accomplishment, he was recalled by the Continental Congress in 1778 and accused of having conflicts of interest and mismanaging funds while carrying out his official duties. He spent the rest of his life trying to clear his name. <br><br>
Deane's large frame house was built at the time of this second marriage in 1769. His career never allowed him to spend much time there, but his second wife, Elizabeth, used it to entertain important visitors, including George Washington. Today the house is furnished to reflect Elizabeth's life there and also interprets the lives of Pomp and Hagar, two enslaved Africans she is believed to have brought to Wethersfield upon her marriage. <br><br>

Oliver Ellsword Homestead
<br><br>
Perhaps Windsor's most prominent citizen, Oliver Ellsworth represented Connecticut at the Continental Congress and was a drafter of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-compromise/" target="_blank">Connecticut Compromise</a> which created the dual system of representation we have today in Congress. The term "United States" was Ellsworth's idea and he was a framer of the Constitution although he never signed the final version.<br><br>
As a powerful political figure and successful lawyer, Ellsworth later served as one of Connecticut's first two Senators where he chaired the committee that created <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/senator-oliver-ellsworths-judiciary-act/" target="_blank">the bill organizing the U.S. Judiciary</a> which defines our court system today, and as the Third Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court under George Washington.<br><br>
The Oliver Ellsworth Homestead, also known as "Elmwood," was built in 1781 and remained the home of Oliver and his wife Abigail Wolcott Ellsworth together until his death in 1807. The interior retains features of the late 18th century and decorative materials associated with the Ellsworth Family.<br><br>
The house is situated in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/windsor/" target="_blank">Windsor</a> on twelve acres of rolling lawns and mature trees. Located just north of the Windsor Historic District and the Windsor Historical Society, a visit to the Homestead can be combined with visits to neighboring historical gems.<br><br>
The Homestead was visited by two sitting Presidents: George Washington (October 21, 1789) and John Adams (October 3, 1799). The house was occupied by the Ellsworth Family until 1903 when all 116 living descendants agreed to transfer ownership to the Connecticut Daughters of the American Revolution who now oversee and maintain this historic property which has been open as a museum since then.<br><br>

Old New-Gate Prison & Copper Mine
<br><br>
The story of Old New-Gate Prison & Copper Mine (one of the most notorious prisons in America) reflects the nation's changing attitudes toward capital punishment and the rights of all people, including criminals, to humane treatment. <br><br>
The prison began as a copper mine in 1705, located in part of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/simsbury/" target="_blank">Simsbury</a> that is now <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/east-granby/" target="_blank">East Granby</a>. After mining became unprofitable, it was determined that the abandoned caverns would make a useful foundation for a prison.<br><br>
The initial prison facility consisted of little more than two vertical shafts leading to a small underground room. Officials thought the arrangement so secure that they didn't bother to post guards at the site. Consequently, when New-Gate's first prisoner (<a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/first-new-gate-prisoner-today-in-history-2/" target="_blank">John Hinson</a>) arrived on December 22, 1773, he escaped after only eighteen days.<br><br>
With the outbreak of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a>, New-Gate's role shifted to that of a military prison. Throughout the war, British sympathizers (known as "Tories"), as well as deserters from the Continental army, spent time confined at New-Gate.<br><br>
Conditions at the prison were harsh. Prisoners spent large portions of their time in darkness where the water that dripped from the ceiling and the walls caused numerous health problems, and the food and other waste left in the cells produced terrible odors. In addition, prisoners were often subjected to verbal and physical abuse by guards as well as by their fellow inmates.<br><br>
In 1824, the completion of a four-story cell block added to what had become a bustling above-ground complex. It included a kitchen, chapel, and numerous manufacturing shops where prisoners produced shoes, nails, wheelbarrows, and other items to offset the cost of prison operations.<br><br>
Ultimately, a poor record for prisoner rehabilitation, combined with crumbling structures, a lack of adequate housing for women, and a growing sensitivity about the rights of criminals to humane treatment, forced the prison to close in 1827. It found new life as tourist attraction in the early twentieth century and became a national historic landmark in 1973. <br><br>

Nathan Hale Homestead
<br><br>
The story of Nathan Hale is one of America's enduring tales of heroic sacrifice and the primary catalyst behind his being named Connecticut's official state hero. Although we don't know what Hale actually looked like, statues commemorating the young patriot can be found in front of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-wadsworth-atheneum-museum-of-art/" target="_blank">Wadsworth Atheneum</a> in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a>, on the campus of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/yale-university-from-colonial-times-to-the-present/" target="_blank">Yale University</a>, at Fort Nathan Hale in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a>, and in front of the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. and the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia.<br><br>
Nathan Hale spent his childhood in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/coventry/" target="_blank">Coventry</a>, Connecticut, before graduating from Yale College and becoming a teacher. During the American Revolution he joined a Connecticut militia unit and was subsequently recruited as a spy by George Washington but was captured on Long Island on his very first mission. He was taken to British-occupied New York City and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/nathan-hale-hanged-in-new-york-today-in-history/" target="_blank">executed on September 22, 1776</a>.<br><br>
His reputed last words assured his place in history: "My only regret is that I have but one life to give for my country." Although it is not clear that this is exactly what Hale said, early accounts suggest that he did deliver a stirring speech on the scaffold.<br><br>
The same year Nathan was hanged, his father tore down the old house where Nathan and his brothers had been born and began building a large new house. Today the Hale Homestead reflects rural life in New England at the time of the American Revolution.<br><br>

<br><br>

The Huntington Homestead
<br><br>
The birthplace (in 1731) of Samuel Huntington, signer of the Declaration of Independence and the first President of "The United States in Congress Assembled," was a farm house built by Samuel's father around 1723. It originally had one large room on each floor with a chimney at one end. Later additions more than doubled the size of the house and gave it its current "saltbox" look.<br><br>
Samuel Huntington grew up the fourth of ten children and spent his youth working on the family farm. Although his brothers attended <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/yale-university-from-colonial-times-to-the-present/" target="_blank">Yale</a>, Samuel never went to college. Instead, he studied law independently and eventually received permission to practice in Connecticut. In 1760, he moved to the bustling town of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/norwich/" target="_blank">Norwich</a>, from which he was soon elected to the Connecticut General Assembly.<br><br>
Huntington's opposition to the taxes and restrictions placed on the colony by the British Parliament helped earn him election to the Continental Congress, and, in 1779, Huntington was selected to serve as its president. During his term, Congress ratified the Articles of Confederation, which established the first national government for the new "United States." For this reason, some people consider Huntington the nation's first president.<br><br>
After returning to Connecticut, Huntington was elected governor in 1786. His speech at the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-ratification-convention/" target="_blank">Connecticut Convention</a> in 1788 in support of the Constitution sheds light into his success as a statesman. In it, Huntington declared, "It does not give me pain, but pleasure, to hear the sentiments of those gentlemen who differ from me. It is not to be expected from human nature, that we should all have the same opinion."<br><br>

Governor Jonathan Trumbull House
<br><br>
Jonathan Trumbull was the only colonial governor to remain in office through the American Revolution. His store in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/lebanon/" target="_blank">Lebanon</a> served as a meeting place for patriots, a center for military planning, and helped supply the Continental army with vital provisions.<br><br>
In the winter of 1780, when General George Washington's troops were camped in New Jersey, Connecticut's Governor, Jonathan Trumbull, sent them a train of ox-drawn sleds loaded with beef and pork. Washington noted in his diary, "No other man than Trumbull could have procured them, and no other state than Connecticut would have furnished them." Again and again during the Revolution, Washington turned to Trumbull for help and Trumbull responded by providing food, clothing, and livestock for Washington's ragged, starving troops.<br><br>
What is now the Jonathan Trumbull House was built by Trumbull's father between 1735 and 1740 and enlarged by Trumbull himself when he moved in with his family in 1755. The younger son of a successful merchant, Trumbull was educated at Harvard College and destined for the ministry. After his older brother was lost at sea, he joined the family business instead.<br><br>
Simultaneously, Trumbull became involved in politics, serving in the Connecticut General Assembly and in the state militia. In 1769, he was elected governor of Connecticut. He remained in office after the Revolutionary War broke out, siding with the colonists. <br><br>
Trumbull continued to serve as Connecticut's governor following American independence. He resigned in 1784 and, a year later, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/governor-jonathan-trumbull-dies/" target="_blank">he died</a> at his home in Lebanon. Like other patriots who spent their fortunes in the cause of liberty, he was bankrupt at the time of his death.<br><br>

The Leffingwell House Museum
<br><br>
The Leffingwell House Museum is a well-preserved example of a Revolutionary War-era tavern. In 1675, Steven Backus built the original two-room house and sold it in 1700 to Ensign Thomas Leffingwell who acquired a license to operate the property as a "publique house for the entertainment of strangers," otherwise known as a tavern. People came to the tavern to purchase rum, tobacco, read newspapers, and discuss political issues of the day.<br><br>
In the late 1750s, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/statesman-and-businessman-christopher-leffingwell-born-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Christopher Leffingwell</a>, a prominent businessman and merchant, inherited the house. Throughout his life, Leffingwell built several mills that processed wool, chocolate, paper, stockings, and more. The products Leffingwell made benefited the self-sufficient consumers in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/norwich/" target="_blank">Norwich</a>, who chose not to rely on imported British goods.<br><br>
A staunch patriot, Christopher Leffingwell became a deputy commissary for the Continental army during the American Revolution and was a confidant of George Washington (who visited Leffingwell at the house in April of 1776). Originally a two-story house, the building evolved into a "double salt box" plan with additions in 1715 and 1760. Today it is a museum and is open seasonally on Saturdays from April to October.<br><br>

The Turtle Submarine
<br><br>
The Turtle is history's first functioning submarine. It was designed by David Bushnell, a student at Yale who experimented with methods of making gunpowder explode under water. In April 1775, after the battles at Lexington and Concord helped launch the Revolutionary War, Bushnell set about building a submarine capable of delivering an underwater mine.<br><br>
The design called for a front propeller--like a giant screw operated by a treadle and a hand crank--to move the vessel. An air-filled chamber was flooded with water to make the submarine sink and the water pumped out to make it rise. A vertical propeller on the top of the boat assisted with ascent. No fresh air and little light could enter the craft when it was submerged, so it travelled on the surface with its hatch above water until ready to attack.<br><br>
Bushnell's plan was to sink the HMS Eagle, the flagship of British Admiral Howe that was anchored in New York Harbor. On <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-turtle-submarine-today-in-history/" target="_blank">September 6, 1776</a>, army volunteer Ezra Lee climbed into the Turtle to conduct the attack, but problems arose when the boring device intended to attach the explosives to the Eagle failed to penetrate the ship's hull and Lee was forced to retreat. The Turtle eventually made two more unsuccessful attempts at sinking enemy ships in the Hudson River before the British sunk a boat transporting the sub and the Turtle was lost.<br><br>
The Connecticut River Museum built and successfully tested the first working reproduction of Bushnell's submarine. You can see a model of the Turtle and learn more about its story at the museum.<br><br>

Fort Trumbull
<br><br>
In colonial times, New London Harbor helped merchants, ship owners, and tradesmen grow wealthy, in-part, from trade with West Indies--shipping out food, lumber, and other supplies from Connecticut to Europe and the islands of the Caribbean and in return receiving sugar, rum, molasses, and slaves. <br><br>
In 1778, at the height of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a>, a fort was erected on the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="">New London</a> side of the harbor, south of the main part of the city. It was named Fort Trumbull, in honor of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/jonathan-trumbull/" target="_blank">Governor Jonathan Trumbull</a>. On September 6, 1781, Colonel William Ledyard was in command of both Fort Trumbull and Fort Griswold</a> (on the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/groton/" target="_blank">Groton</a> side of the harbor) when New London suffered disaster at the hands of one of history's most notorious traitors, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/benedict-arnold-americas-most-famous-traitor/" target="_blank">Benedict Arnold</a>.<br><br>
Arnold and half his force--about 800 British, Hessian, and Loyalist troops--landed on the New London side of the harbor, while the other half was sent to attack Fort Griswold. Realizing that they could not possibly hold Fort Trumbull, the soldiers stationed there quickly crossed the harbor to help defend Fort Griswold, and the residents of New London fled.<br><br>
Arnold's troops set fire to the warehouses by the wharves and the fire quickly spread to the rest of the town. The Connecticut Gazette identified 143 buildings that had been destroyed, including sixty-five houses (home to ninety-seven families), eighteen shops, twenty barns, and nine public buildings (including the courthouse, church, and jail.) <br><br>
The site of Fort Trumbull is now a Connecticut State Park. The current fortifications date from 1839-1852.<br><br>

Fort Griswold
<br><br>
Fort Griswold was erected in 1778 to help defend the prosperous seaport of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a>. Located at the mouth of the Thames River, on the Groton Heights side of New London Harbor, it proved the perfect compliment to Fort Trumbull, which was erected that same year on the New London side. On September 6, 1781, Colonel William Ledyard was in command of both forts when 1,600 British, Hessian and Loyalist troops, under the command of the traitorous <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/benedict-arnold-americas-most-famous-traitor/" target="_blank">Benedict Arnold</a>, raided New London.<br><br>
Arnold, who was born in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/norwich/" target="_blank">Norwich</a>, Connecticut, and served as an officer in the Continental army during the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a>, switched his allegiance to the British in 1780 after facing financial troubles and being frustrated by what he saw as a lack of respect and recognition for him by the Continental Congress. <br><br>
On the night of September 6, Fort Griswold was defended by approximately 160 militiamen and volunteers who faced an attack by roughly 800 men (half of Arnold's force). Six Americans were killed and twenty wounded in the initial conflict before Colonel Ledyard commanded his men to put down their arms. What happened next remains something of a historical debate. It is said that upon surrendering his sword, Ledyard was run through with his own weapon by a British officer and the British troops then slaughtered the remaining Americans. By the end of the attack, eighty-five Americans were dead and thirty-six were wounded. The devastation wrought by Arnold's raid was felt in the area for years afterward.<br><br>
The granite monument to those who fought and died at the Battle of Groton Heights was completed in 1830 and renovated in 1881. Fort Griswold was designated a state park in 1953.<br><br>
