The Boat Building


The Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Building (known locally as the "Boat Building") is a significant example of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/modernism-in-connecticut-through-photographs/" target="_blank">modernist architectural style</a> common in many urban renewal projects of the 1950s and 1960s. The building's unusual shape is known technically as an "elliptic lenticular cylinder," and when it was completed in 1963, it was the world's first two-sided office building.<br><br>The building was designed by renowned architect Max Abramovitz of the firm Harrison & Abramovitz, also known for their work on the United Nations Headquarters and Lincoln Center in New York City. Abramovitz designed the building as a reflection of the company's progressive approach and forward-thinking. While Phoenix had been founded in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a> in 1851, it was the company's decision to stay in downtown Hartford that anchored the city's urban renewal movement of the 1960s, one of the earliest in the nation. State and national newspapers followed every step of construction, and in 1964, the first year of operation, 12,000 visitors toured the building.<br><br>The thirteen-story "Boat Building" measures 225 feet along its axis and 87 feet at its widest point and is constructed of steel with glass curtain walls. It is the first New England office building to be both LEED (Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design)-certified (2010) and on the National Register of Historic Places (2005).<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-phoenix-building-hartford/" target_blank">More</a> on the "Boat Building"

Connecticut State Capitol Building


Between the years 1701 and 1874, Connecticut had two capital cities:<a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a> and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a>. The General Assembly met in both on a rotating schedule, and there were two capitol buildings. By the 1860s, both buildings needed repairs, and the practicality of maintaining two capitols was in question. After much debate, Hartford was named <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/a-tale-of-two-capitals/" target="_blank">sole capital</a> in 1873, effective two years later. Work began on a new state capitol on a plot of land previously occupied by <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/trinity-college-scholarship-and-community-engagement/" target="_blank">Trinity College</a>.<br><br>The capitol was completed in 1878, using marble and granite from Connecticut and neighboring states. Richard Mitchell Upjohn, a New York-based architect, designed the High Victorian Gothic style building, incorporating a variety of other architectural influences as well. Taking inspiration from medieval architecture, this style was popular for schools, churches, and government buildings and often featured pointed arches, stone construction, and steeply gabled roofs.<br><br>Statues and relief sculpture on the building's exterior highlight important people and scenes from Connecticut's history. The dome is surrounded by six pairs of statues representing Agriculture, Commerce, Education/Law, Force/War, Science/Justice, and Music. The dome was once topped by 17'-tall bronze statue called Genius of Connecticut, which was removed (after being damaged in the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-hurricane-of-1938-rocks-connecticut/" target=_blank">1938 hurricane</a>) and melted down during <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-ii/" target="_blank">World War II</a>. A replica was cast in 2009.<br><br>The building's interior features marble floors, gilding, brass fixtures, and elaborate stenciling. Since 1879, it has also <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/hall-of-flags-memorial-to-connecticuts-civil-war-colors/" target="_blank">housed the flags</a> of Connecticut military units from the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/civil-war/" target="_blank">Civil War</a> on.<br><br>The capitol was named a National Historical Landmark in 1971.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticuts-capitol-building-inside-and-out/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Connecticut State Capitol Building<br><br><a href="http://www.ctvisit.com/listings/state-capitol-legislative-office-building" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Connecticut State Capitol Building

Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch


On September 17, 1886, the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch was dedicated in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a> to honor the 4,000 Hartford residents who served, and the nearly 400 who died, in the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/civil-war/" target="_blank">Civil War</a>. Designed by Hartford architect George Keller, the monument was the first permanent triumphal arch erected in the United States. The monument consists of two Romanesque-style towers joined by a Gothic Revival pointed arch and decorative frieze. It is made from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/portland/" target="_blank">Portland</a> (CT) brownstone and cost about $60,000 in city funds to build.<br><br>The monument tells the story of Hartford's role in the Civil War. The life-sized terra cotta frieze depicts scenes of war sculpted by Samuel Kitson on the north side and scenes of peace and victory by sculptor Caspar Buberl on the south side. On the south frieze, Hartford is represented by the figure of a seated woman, below which appears the Latin motto, post nubila phoebus: after clouds, the sun. Midway up the monument, eight-foot-tall statues designed by German-born sculptor Albert Entress represent those from Hartford who served in the Union army: student, farmer, freed slave, carpenter, stone mason, and blacksmith. The newer plaque under the statue of the freed slave honors the 128 African American residents of Hartford who fought for the Union.<br><br>When George Keller died in 1935 at the age of 93, his family had his remains cremated and interred behind a plaque in the interior of the east tower. His wife Mary's ashes are there as well.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-soldiers-and-sailors-memorial-arch-hartford/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Arch<br><br>Visit Bushnell Park

The Austin House


The 1930 <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/hartfords-facade-house-the-unique-home-of-chick-austin/" target="_blank">Austin House</a> in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a>'s historic West End is the former home of A. Everett "Chick" Austin Jr., the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-wadsworth-atheneum-museum-of-art/" target="_blank">Wadsworth Atheneum</a>'s innovative director from 1927 to 1944, and his wife, Helen Goodwin. The inspiration for the Neo-Classical Revival house was Italian architect Vincenzo Scamozzi's 1596 Villa Ferretti at Dolo, Italy. Although the Austins hired a New York City architect, the design was essentially Chick's. The two-story, 3,000-square-foot house is notable for its long and narrow design--86 feet long, but only 18 feet deep. Although the pilaster-adorned façade is flat, it provides an illusion of depth.<br><br>The house's interior is as unique as its exterior. Many rooms take up the full depth of the building. The Austins decorated the first floor with 17th- to 20th-century Italian and German furnishings, while giving the second floor a modern flair, including designs from Bauhaus artist Marcel Breuer.<br><br>Austin's home was a gathering place, where he entertained Salvador Dali, Le Corbusier, Gertrude Stein, Alexander Calder, and many other artists, performers, and intellectuals of the period. The start of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-ii/" target="_blank">World War II</a> curtailed both Austin's social life and his ability to acquire works for the Atheneum. In 1944, in the midst of a dispute with the museum's trustees, Austin resigned his position as director.<br><br>Chick Austin died in 1957. His wife Helen and their two children donated the property to the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1985. In 1994 the house was named a National Historic Landmark.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/chick-austin-modernizes-a-connecticut-institution-2/" target="_blank">More</a> on Chick Austin<br><br><a href="https://www.thewadsworth.org/collection/austinhouse/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Austin House

Heublein Tower


Heublein Tower is actually the fourth tower built on Talcott Mountain. The first one, built by Daniel Wadsworth in 1810, blew down; Wadsworth's second tower burned. In 1867, Matthew Bartlett built a tower that included a tavern and areas for picnicking and dancing. <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/samuel-clemens-1835-1910/" target="_blank">Mark Twain</a> and his friends frequently made the eight-mile hike from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a> to visit it.<br><br>Gilbert F. Heublein, a successful businessman (best-known as a liquor distributor and for producing A-1 Steak Sauce) built the current tower. Heublein was born in Bavaria and moved to Connecticut as a child. While hiking with his fiancé on Talcott Mountain in 1875, Gilbert promised to build her a castle on the mountain. In 1914, he fulfilled that promise. The six-story, steel-framed, 165-foot tower was designed by Smith & Bassette to withstand 100-mph winds and is anchored into the bedrock. It was used mainly as a summer retreat by the Heubleins. There was a bedroom or living room on each floor, and the top floor--now the observation deck--was a ballroom, used for parties and entertaining. An addition with staff rooms, a larger kitchen, and a dining room was completed in 1929.<br><br>Gilbert Heublein died in 1937, and in 1943 the tower was purchased by the Hartford Times. It continued to be used for parties and events frequented by famous guests. The State of Connecticut purchased the tower and 557 surrounding acres in 1966. Heublein Tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.<br><br><a href="https://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&q=325272&deepNav_GID=1650" target="_blank">Visit</a> Talcott Mountain State Park

West Cornwall Covered Bridge


Measuring 172 feet long and 15 feet wide, the West Cornwall Covered Bridge carries traffic over the Housatonic River on Connecticut Route 128. One of the last covered bridges in Connecticut, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been a symbol of the area's rural heritage for over 150 years.<br><br>Attempts to build bridges at the site go back as far as 1762, but ice storms and floods claimed these early structures. Research has shown that the current bridge was likely built in 1864. It is constructed of red spruce, which is stronger than oak, and held together using treenails--wooden pegs that are wedged into place. It is a lattice truss bridge, a light-weight, efficient, and durable design <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/town-patents-the-lattice-truss-bridge-today-in-history/" target="_blank">patented in 1820</a> by Connecticut architect <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/ithiel-town/" target="_blank">Ithiel Town</a>. The bridge was painted its distinctive red color in 1957.<br><br>Despite its sturdy construction, the bridge has faced numerous challenges, including hurricanes, floods, fire, and heavier vehicle traffic. In 1945, a twenty-ton oil truck fell through the bridge floor. By 1968, the demands on the bridge had changed so much since its original construction that the State of Connecticut considered replacing the one-hundred-year-old structure. A local group committed to saving the bridge stepped in and convinced the state to make renovations instead. In 1973 the Connecticut Department of Transportation inserted a steel support deck that not only saved the bridge but also earned an award from the Federal Highway Administration as an outstanding example of historic preservation.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/west-cornwall-covered-bridge-an-icon-of-new-england-craftsmanship/" target="_blank">More</a> on the West Cornwall Covered Bridge

The Glass House


Architect Philip Johnson's Glass House is considered a masterwork of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/modernism-in-connecticut-through-photographs/" target="_blank">modern American architecture</a>. Built in 1949, the house is an important example of International Style architecture, which is characterized by a complete lack of ornament, simple geometric forms, flat surfaces, and the use of mass-produced, industrial materials.<br><br>Philip Johnson was born in 1906 in Cleveland, Ohio. After graduating from Harvard University, Johnson traveled to Europe, where he encountered the architecture of modernists like Mies van der Rohe, Gropius, and Le Corbusier. In 1930, Johnson became director of the architectural department at the new Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In the mid-1930s he left MoMA and traveled through Europe as a correspondent for Father Charles Coughlin's pro-fascist, anti-Semitic newspaper Social Justice. Abandoning right-wing politics and journalism shortly before the United States entered <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-ii/" target="_blank">World War II</a>, Johnson returned to Harvard's School of Design to study architecture under Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer.<br><br>Immediately after completing his studies, Johnson began work on the Glass House, which became his home for nearly sixty years. The kitchen, dining area, and sleeping area are one open room; the bathroom is enclosed in a brick cylinder. The exterior walls are made of glass and steel; Johnson referred to the view as his "wallpaper." In addition to the house itself, the forty-seven-acre estate encompassed thirteen other buildings and structures, including a guest house and sculpture gallery. Philip Johnson died at his estate on January 25, 2005, at the age of ninety-eight.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/philip-johnson-in-his-own-words/" target="_blank">More</a> on Phillip Johnson<br><br><a href="http://theglasshouse.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Glass House

The Barnum Museum


<a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/p-t-barnum/" target="_blank">P. T. (Phineas Taylor) Barnum</a> is best remembered as one of the greatest entertainment entrepreneurs in history, having built a career--and a fortune--from traveling shows, museums filled with curiosities, and a world-famous circus. Less-known is Barnum's interest in combining education and entertainment, the shocking idea--for the time--that learning could also be fun.<br><br>The building that today houses the Barnum Museum is the last surviving structure directly associated with Barnum. Barnum envisioned the Barnum Institute of Science and History as a showcase of cultural and scientific achievement. It would house the Bridgeport Scientific Society, Fairfield County Historical Society, and the Bridgeport Medical Society, and include a research library, exhibit galleries, lecture hall, and observatory.<br><br>Designed and constructed by the Bridgeport firm Longstaff and Hurd, the building is an example of Romanesque Revival style, with characteristic rounded arches and heavy masonry walls. The three-story structure is built of sandstone, brick, and terra cotta and features a frieze depicting historical events and figures and a large dome. Having lost his New York museums, winter circus quarters, and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/bridgeport/" target="_blank">Bridgeport</a> mansion Iranistan to fire, Barnum ensured that the building was equipped with a fireproof stairway and fireproof vaults for artifact storage.<br><br>Barnum contributed land, money, and collections to the project but did not live to see it completed. He approved plans for the building's construction just three weeks before <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/p-t-barnum-dies-today-in-history/" target="_blank">his death</a> in 1891.

Henry Whitfield State Museum


The Henry Whitfield House (home to the Henry Whitfield State Museum) is not only Connecticut's oldest house and the oldest stone house in New England, but was also constructed to serve as a protective fort for some of Connecticut's earliest settlers.<br><br>Henry Whitfield became an ordained minister of the Church of England in 1618. By the 1630s, however, Separatists and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/whats-a-puritan-and-why-didnt-they-stay-in-massachusetts/" target="_blank">Puritans</a> found themselves threatened by the increasingly restrictive policies of England's King Charles I. In response, Whitfield gathered approximately forty families and emigrated to the southern shores of (what later became) Connecticut. After consulting with his friends George Fenwick (who helped found the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lion-gardiner-helps-to-fortify-early-old-saybrook/" target="_blank">Saybrook Colony</a>) and the Reverend <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/forgotten-founder-john-davenport-of-new-haven/" target="_blank">John Davenport</a> (who founded the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/a-separate-place-the-new-haven-colony-1638-1665/" target="_blank">New Haven Colony</a>), Whitfield and his fellow colonists purchased land from the Menuncatuck people and founded what is now <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/guilford/" target="_blank">Guilford</a>, Connecticut. He served as Guilford's first minister and an important community leader for twelve years.<br><br>Construction of the Henry Whitfield House began in 1639 and was probably completed the following year. Whitfield lived there with his wife, Dorothy, and five to seven (of their nine) children until 1651, when most of the family returned to England following the execution of King Charles I and the establishment of Puritan leader Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector. Once back in England, Whitfield led a parish in the Winchester Diocese until his death in 1657. He is buried at Winchester Cathedral.<br><br>The Henry Whitfield House went through several owners and renovations over the next centuries before becoming Connecticut's first State Museum in 1900.

Gillette Castle


American actor, playwright, and director <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/william-gillette/" target="_blank">William Gillette</a> built this extraordinary stone castle above the Connecticut River in East Haddam. Gillette was born in the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/hartfords-nook-farm/" target="_blank">Nook Farm</a> neighborhood of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a>. His father was the socially-progressive former U.S. Senator Francis Gillette; his mother, Elizabeth Daggett Hooker Gillette, was a descendant of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/timeline-settlement-of-the-colony-of-connecticut/" target="_blank">Connecticut Colony</a> founder <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/thomas-hooker/" target="_blank">Thomas Hooker</a>.<br><br>Gillette left home at the age of twenty to pursue a career in the theater. He was most famous for his stage portrayal of Arthur Conan Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes, a role in which he appeared 1,300 times over more than thirty years. It was Gillette who introduced audiences to the deerstalker cap, long traveling cloak, and curved pipe that would become hallmarks of the detective. It was also Gillette who wrote the phrase, "Oh, this is elementary, my dear fellow," which film actor Clive Brook later modified to "Elementary, my dear Watson." Neither phrase ever appeared in any of Doyle's works.<br><br>Gillette made a fortune playing Holmes and used part of that money, as well as his sense of ingenuity and fun, to build his European-inspired castle. Gillette designed much of the castle himself and named it "Seventh Sister." Built between 1914 and 1919, and made from Connecticut stone, the castle has twenty-four rooms with puzzle locks, secret doors, cleverly-designed furniture, and hidden mirrors that allowed Gillette to spy on his guests (including Albert Einstein and Calvin Coolidge). The estate also featured walking trails and a three-mile-long narrow-gauge railroad.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/william-gillettes-last-performance-today-in-history/" target="_blank">More</a> on William Gillette<br><br><a href="https://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&q=325204&deepNav_GID=1650" target="_blank">Visit</a> Gillette Castle State Park

Thomas Lee House and Museum


The Thomas Lee House in the Niantic section of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/east-lyme/" target="_blank">East Lyme</a> is one of the oldest wood-frame houses in Connecticut. Built around 1660, the saltbox house--a typical New England style characterized by its long, pitched roof down the back--began as a small structure but grew over time.<br><br>Thomas Lee Sr. and his family left Sussex, England in 1641 for the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lion-gardiner-helps-to-fortify-early-old-saybrook/" target="_blank">Saybrook Colony</a> in North America. Thomas never made it to his new home, dying of smallpox on the way. The arduous cross-Atlantic journey took its toll on his family as well, and they spent roughly two months recuperating in Boston before finally heading to Connecticut.<br><br>Lee's son (also "Thomas") built the house that stands today. Initially, the house was a single hall on the first floor with a chamber and attic above and a massive fireplace at the west end. Over time, Thomas became successful, acquiring large tracts of land in the area. He was also very active locally as a surveyor, keeper of town records, and officer in charge of verifying weights and measures. His growing family prompted a series of expansions that gave the house its current layout. In 1700, the house was doubled in size through the addition on the west side of a parlor and the "West Chamber." The lean-to, with a kitchen and several adjoining rooms, was added around 1765.<br><br>The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is owned and maintained by the <a href="https://eastlymehistoricalsociety.org/index.html" target="_blank">East Lyme Historical Society</a>.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/a-connecticut-home-that-dates-back-to-the-1600s/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Thomas Lee House<br><br><a href="https://eastlymehistoricalsociety.org/index_files/Page376.htm" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Thomas Lee House

The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center


The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center located in Mashantucket, Connecticut, is a tribally owned-and-operated complex, and brings to life the story of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. It serves as a major resource on the history of the Tribe, the histories and cultures of other tribes, and the region's natural history.<br><br>At 308,000 square feet, the museum is the largest Native American museum in the world. Approximately one-third of the building is dedicated to exhibits, covering 20,000 years of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/native-americans/" target="_blank">Native American</a> and natural history.<br><br>The museum has four distinct features. First, the design of its glass enclosed "gathering space" was inspired by the overlapping semi-circular enclosure of Mistick Fort, a 17th century Pequot village that was attacked and massacred by an English military force and their Native American allies.<br><br>Second, the façade of the museum, comprised of large, rectangular slabs of light gray, black, and rose-colored stone represents a wampum belt, a traditional form of personal ornamentation and relationship building that remains culturally significant to Native people in the Northeastern United States.<br><br>Third, the Museum is the site of an award-winning <a href="https://www.buildinggreen.com/newsbrief/2006-green-roof-awards-excellence" target="_blank">green roof</a> that allows the building to seamlessly integrate into natural surroundings of the adjacent Cedar Swamp, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing and ecologically sensitive design. The 60,000 square foot green roof covers all of the museum's permanent exhibits and is a venue for outdoor events and museum educational programs.<br><br>Finally, the Museum's 185-foot observation tower, provides visitors a commanding view of traditional Pequot homelands in eastern Connecticut.
