Ridgefield: Revolutionary War<br><br>

Orientation <br><br>
The events that occurred around Ridgefield in April 1777 constituted the only inland invasion of Connecticut during the Revolution. This tour follows the retreat of the British to the coast, showcases the sites where history was made, and introduces the critical players who galvanized Patriot forces against the crown.<br><br>

David Scott House (4 Sunset Lane)<br><br>

It's complicated! The 1714 David Scott House, today the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/" target="_blank">Ridgefield Historical Society</a>, and its original residents share a scandalous and intriguing past.<br><br>The 18th-century technique of pegged construction made relocating homes with manual labor and an oxen cart commonplace. The <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/scott-house/" target="_blank">Scott House</a> moved not once, but twice, from its prominent multi-acre site on Main Street, where British soldiers marched past its doors, to the smaller side street, Catoonah, and in 2002, to Sunset Lane.<br><br>The building was not the only thing that got around! The House's namesake, born in Ireland in 1678, married, then abandoned his wife, Mary, before emigrating to America. He became one of Ridgefield's Original Proprietors and entered a new relationship with Elizabeth St. John. Unexpectedly, Mary arrived in America and filed suit against her husband, citing Elizabeth as the "pretended wife of David Scott." Unheard of for the time, a judge awarded Mary three acres of her husband's land.<br><br>Circa 1741, Scott sold his home and two enslaved persons to his daughter, Rachel, and son-in-law, Vivus Dauchy. He lived with them until his death in 1760, when his remaining enslaved person was listed in his estate. Rachel bore seven children before dying in 1748; Dauchy lived to father six more children and become Captain of the First Ridgefield Company. A fervent patriot, when British troops torched his neighbor -- St. Stephen's Church -- he offered his home for meetings until the church was reconstructed.<br><br>The Scott House remained in the Dauchy Family for 111 years. The "Scotland District" of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> is named for the Scott Family.

<br><br>

Smith Tavern (472 Main Street)<br><br>

Remains of the Day! Ridgefield's original twenty-five proprietors appointed Ebenezer Smith as its tavern keeper in 1718. His job was to make food and shelter available to travelers that came to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>. Smith, who moved from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/milford/" target="_blank">Milford</a>, became the town's 26th Proprietor in 1709. He operated the Tavern out of his home.<br><br>Shortly after the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/battle-at-ridgefield-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Battle of Ridgefield</a>, a cannonball was dislodged from a tree in front of Ebenezer Smith's house. This was one of many cannonballs that surfaced over the centuries, with the last one found in 1975.<br><br>In 1797, one of Ebenezer's descendants, Amos Smith, tore down the original structure, built a new one, and established a cider mill on the property. The newly expanded Smith Tavern had a tap-room downstairs for serving food and drink. Above the tap-room, was a large room known as Mr. Smith's Assembly Room, that served as a gathering place for community activities, Masonic Lodge meetings, balls, and even as a court room. This all-purpose hospitality and community space must have been in great demand at the time since the <a href="http://www.keelertavernmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Keeler Tavern</a> provided the same services at the other end of Main Street.<br><br>Amos Smith died at the age of 86 in 1855 leaving behind a wife and twelve children. Smith Tavern became solely a residence for the first time and was passed down to Evelyn Smith, Amos's granddaughter, who sold the property in 1900 to James N. Morris, who built the <a href="https://ridgefieldlibrary.org/" target="_blank">Ridgefield Library</a> on the site in memory of his wife Elizabeth.

<br><br>

Stebbins House (550 Main Street)<br><br>

New England Patriots! During the War, Benjamin Stebbins, who lived on Main Street, was contending with a divided family: he and his two sons, Benjamin, Jr. and Josiah, were loyalists and his three other sons were patriots.<br><br>In April 1777, British ships landed at Compo Beach with 2,000 men and artillery with orders to march to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/danbury/" target="_blank">Danbury</a> to destroy a large supply of patriot provisions. General William Tryon's men burned the stores and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-burning-of-danbury/" target="_blank">set fire to the town</a>. An alarm was issued and Patriots rallied to Generals David Wooster, Gold Silliman, and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/benedict-arnold/" target="_blank">Benedict Arnold</a>, who decided to split their forces. Wooster twice attacked the British column as it headed south and was fatally shot. Arnold and Silliman took their men cross country to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>.<br><br>Arnold set up a barricade across the narrowest part of Main Street, right next to the Stebbins house. In <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/battle-at-ridgefield-today-in-history/" target="_blank">the battle</a> at the barricade, his horse was shot out from under him. When approached by a British soldier carrying a fixed bayonet, Arnold was faster and shot the soldier dead.<br><br>Benjamin was 86 years old and refused to leave his house. He stayed in an upstairs bedroom, only to have a bullet pierce through the wall and lodge in the door over his head! The house caught fire, but Josiah was allowed to extinguish the flames. A scarred door from the battle is on display at the <a href="http://www.keelertavernmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Keeler Tavern</a>.<br><br>Wounded soldiers were taken to the Stebbins home. Those who died, from both sides, were buried together on the site.

<br><br>

Phillip Burr Bradley House (485 Main Street)<br><br>

To High Treason! Appointed Justice-of-the-Peace by King George III and despite his history of loyal service to the crown, when the War began, Philip Burr Bradley inexplicably sided with the patriots. In 1777, he accepted a commission to lead the newly created 5th Connecticut Regiment of the Continental Line, which he commanded until 1781. Bradley was charged to turn his Regiment of recruits into able soldiers. During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/battle-at-ridgefield-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Battle of Ridgefield</a>, according to Jones' Farmers Against the Crown, Bradley was "nowhere to be found, having presumably removed post-haste to Peekskill" for fear that his high rank would have made him a likely hostage for future exchange of a similarly ranked British officer. The 5th went on to follow George Washington, fighting in the Battles of Germantown and Monmouth, and remained with him through that deadly winter at Valley Forge.<br><br>Philip Burr Bradley was born in Connecticut and moved to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> in 1759, taking up residence in a large house which stood on Main Street in what is now Ballard Park. Having proven himself through enduring service, after the war President Washington appointed Bradley first Marshall of the District of Connecticut, which placed him in charge of all military operations within the state. He served in this position throughout Washington's two terms and continued under President John Adams.<br><br>As famous in his day as his cousin, Vice President Aaron Burr, Bradley served as a representative of Connecticut. On January 9, 1788, Bradley's signature helped mark <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticut-ratifies-us-constitution-today-in-history-2/" target="_blank">Connecticut's approval</a> in the ratification of the US Constitution.

<br><br>

St. Stephen's Church (351 Main Street)<br><br>

Seek and ye shall find! <a href="https://ststephensridgefield.org/" target="_blank">St. Stephen's Episcopal Church</a> was founded in 1725 by Samuel Johnson, founder of Kings College, now Columbia University, and a former Congregational minister who converted to the Church of England.<br><br>The predominant religion in Connecticut was the Puritans' Congregational Church. Believing that the Church of England was corrupt, the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/whats-a-puritan-and-why-didnt-they-stay-in-massachusetts/" target="_blank">Puritans</a> left England seeking a place to practice their religion freely.<br><br>By 1710, The Church of England, which became the Episcopal Church, was growing in the colonies. When <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> was settled in 1708, there was only one Episcopal Church in Connecticut, and the state's general assembly allowed dissenters their own churches so long as they continued to pay taxes to support the Congregational Church.<br><br>Ridgefield's first Episcopal church was built in 1740 on land granted by the Proprietors who founded the town. It had twenty families as members.<br><br>In 1776, St. Stephen's minister, Epinetus Townsend, a Tory, was ordered to leave town with his wife and five children. He was appointed chaplain to a British regiment and in 1779, the battalion was ordered to Nova Scotia. En route by vessel, a severe storm arose and all passengers were lost. The church was taken over by the commissary department of the American Army. During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/battle-at-ridgefield-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Battle of Ridgefield</a>, British troops set it on fire.<br><br>The partially burned church sat empty until the war ended in 1783 and was not reconstructed until 1791. In 1841, the second church was removed and a third, larger church was built -- containing an organ. Aging and in disrepair it was replaced with the present stone church, completed in 1914.

<br><br>

Joshua King House (267 Main Street)<br><br>

Befriend your Enemy! A British officer suspected of conspiring with <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/benedict-arnold-americas-most-famous-traitor/" target="_blank">Benedict Arnold</a> to surrender West Point was delivered to Lieutenant Joshua King's South Salem, New York, headquarters on September 23, 1780. King, who enlisted at the age of seventeen, was part of the Second Regiment Light Dragoons. He took charge of the prisoner, Major John Andre, who was captured while traveling from West Point to New York City to meet with British Commander, Sir Henry Clinton. Evidence of a plot -- a map of West Point given to Andre by Arnold -- was found in his boot!<br><br>During a brief detention, an affable relationship between the two enemies ensued before the prisoner was relocated to George Washington's headquarters to stand trial as a British spy. King remained by his friend's side and, it is said, accompanied him to the gallows. Andre was hanged in Tappan, New York, on October 2, 1780.<br><br>After the War, King moved to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>, became a leading citizen (he was affectionately nicknamed "General" King) and married the daughter of the minister of the Congregational Church, the beautiful Anne Ingersoll. In 1783, he started the mercantile business King and Dole, with his fellow officer, Lieutenant James Dole.<br><br>King served as first selectman, state representative, and a delegate to the Connecticut Constitutional Convention. In 1817, he wrote a personal account in a correspondence to a friend describing his experience with Major Andre. The letter can be found in George L. Rockwell's <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheHistoryOfRidgefieldConnecticut/page/n7" target="_blank">The History of Ridgefield, Connecticut</a>.

Commons/Congregational Church (207 Main Street)<br><br>

Site-Specific! After the Township of Ridgefield was purchased from Native Americans in 1707-08, the town's first government, the Congregational Society, was created by the original Proprietors of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> in 1712. It was agreed that one-twenty-eighth of the new township, part of the Common green, would be given to the first religious organization who appointed Reverend Thomas Hauley as its first pastor in 1713.<br><br>On the village green, a small meeting house was constructed in 1724. This important building served as the headquarters for the Society, which was the center of all the town's religious, governmental, and educational activities.<br><br> Reverend Hauley died in 1738. He was replaced by Reverend Jonathan Ingersoll who led the Church for the next 39 years.<br><br>In 1775, Ridgefield did not support the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a> and it was understood that this stance was largely influenced by the Reverend Ingersoll. Over the course of that year, votes were taken on more than one occasion and, finally, in December the tide turned and Ridgefield elected to join the Patriots.<br><br>Samuel Goodrich became the new pastor in 1786. Samuel Goodrich Jr., who used the pen name <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/peter-parley-schoolhouse/" target="_blank">Peter Parley</a>, remembered his father's church in his book <a href="https://archive.org/details/recollectionsofl01ingood/page/n8" target="_blank">Recollections of a Lifetime</a> as "a white wooden meeting house... it stood in a small grassy square, the favorite pasture of numerous flocks of geese, and the frequent playground of school-boys, especially on Saturday afternoons."<br><br>As the town grew, the small meeting house was replaced with a larger church in 1800. The present church was built in 1888 and it continues to serve the community today.

<br><br>

King & Dole Store (258 Main Street)<br><br>

Changing Partners! In 1783, fellow <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a> officers Lieutenants Joshua King and James Dole, started the mercantile business King & Dole across the street from King's home on Main Street. Their one-story, gable-roofed construction would later come to be known as "Old Hundred," receiving the nickname after being in use as a store for a full century. Over the course of that hundred years, King & Dole served a variety of functions for <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> including the town' first official post office with Lieutenant King serving as its first postmaster.<br><br>In 1805, Lieutenant Dole left the business and William Hawley became King's new partner. The store changed its name to King & Hawley and the partners stayed in business together for the next 35 years, until King's death in 1840.<br><br>Over the next few decades there were a number of partners. In 1867, the business changed hands again when it was purchased by D. Smith Gage. In 1884, he moved it north on Main Street to the corner of Bailey Avenue, and shortly after it was sold, it became the source of the Great Fire of 1895.<br><br>"Old Hundred" was sold as a home and extensions were made upon the property. Loathe to lose the historic gabled roof, the new owner carved a first floor and basement into the slope, making the original building the new top floor. The building now acts as administrative offices for the <a href="http://aldrichart.org/" target="_blank">Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum</a>.

<br><br>

Hauley House (236 Main Street)<br><br>

Over Budget! The Hawleys in this country date back to 1629 when Joseph Hawley left England for Boston. One of his grandchildren, the Reverend Thomas Hauley (note spelling), 1689-1738, was the first to settle in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> from Massachusetts, and became the town's first pastor. He was a graduate of Harvard College, class of 1709, and this prestigious education prepared him well for his new post which included duties as schoolteacher and town clerk.<br><br>In the original division of 1708, Lot #5 had been set aside as the home of the future minister. Built in the early 1700s, Hauley House is considered the oldest home in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>. The house is interesting architecturally, with a gambrel roof and a flare of the eaves that suggest a Dutch influence from the Hudson River Valley. It is said that the Reverend had to pay ten pounds out if his own "sallery" because he wanted a larger and more formal house (with a double chimney) than what was customary. The catslide roof was common for farm houses of the era, and serves as a reminder that until the mid-20th century, most Ridgefield residents made their living by farming.<br><br>The Reverend Hauley died prematurely at the age of 49 and is buried in the Titicus Cemetery. He was greatly esteemed in the town annals and was the father of ten children. During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a>, his descendants, like many families of British ancestry, found themselves divided with brother fighting against brother in the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/battle-at-ridgefield-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Battle of Ridgefield</a>.

<br><br>

Keeler Tavern Museum (132 Main Street)<br><br>

An Ill Wind! During the American Revolution, as the British marched down Ridgefield's main street, they burned St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, which was being used as a storehouse for supplies. At the southern end of the road they spied two homes built closely together which were owned by relatives, Mr. Timothy Keeler, Jr. and Mr. Benjamin Hoyt, Jr. Keeler, the owner of Ridgefield's historic <a href="http://www.keelertavernmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Keeler Tavern</a>, which opened in 1772, and the nephew of Mr. Hoyt, was a patriot, while his uncle was a loyalist.<br><br>The tale of "the Tory Hoyt," describes the intended burning of the tavern by the British when they placed a cannon in front of St. Stephen's Church, and fired several shots down the street (one of the cannonballs can be seen today in the façade of the Keeler Tavern). Keeler and his family were forced out of their home to stand by and watch as it burned. It was only with the intervention of Hoyt, who argued that if his nephew's home burned his own would most likely go up with it, that he managed to convince the British to let them save the Keeler home. Later, it is famously reported, that after the fire was put out Hoyt wanted thanks from his nephew and said "You may thank me your house is safe" to which Keeler snapped "No sir, I will not thank a Tory for anything. I would rather thank the Lord for the north wind."
