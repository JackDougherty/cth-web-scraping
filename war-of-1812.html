Isaac Hull<br><br>
During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a>, Isaac Hull served as the commander of the USS Constitution. His victory over the HMS Guerriere helped rally American support for the war by destroying the myth of British invincibility on the ocean.<br><br>Born in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/derby/" target="_blank">Derby</a> in 1773, Isaac Hull began his naval career at the age of fourteen. By nineteen he was in command of his own ship. At twenty-five he became a fourth lieutenant on the USS Constitution.<br><br>The Constitution was a 44-gun war frigate and the pride of the US Navy upon its launch in 1797. Not only did its size and speed inspire awe, but its construction of pine, oak, and red cedar (covered on its hull by a copper sheath) made the ship extremely durable.<br><br>In 1812, the United States needed all of its seventeen ships to defend its interests against the British's seven-hundred-ship navy. In June of that year, Hull assumed command of the USS Constitution.<br><br>On August 19, sailing off the coast of Nova Scotia, the Constitution's crew spotted the HMS Guerriere. Intent on taking the Constitution, the British began closing and firing. Several shots bounced off the Constitution's sturdy hull, giving birth to the ship's nickname, "Old Ironsides." After an intense battle, the Americans managed to knock out the masts on the Guerriere and the British ship began to sink. The Americans took the British sailors prisoner before setting fire to the Guerriere and returning to Boston victorious.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/fame-and-infamy-for-the-hulls-of-derby/" target="_blank">More</a> on Isaac Hull<br><br><a href="http://www.derbyhistorical.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Derby Historical Society

Whitney Armory<br><br>
<a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/eli-whitney/" target="_blank">Eli Whitney</a> is famous for the cotton gin, which revolutionized the processing of cotton. What is slightly less well-known is that Whitney later established an armory in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hamden/" target="_blank">Hamden</a> that produced weapons used by the United States during the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a> and contributed to the evolution of mass-produced firearms.<br><br>Born in 1765, Whitney spent his youth working on his father's farm. As a young man, he intended to study law and traveled to Savannah, Georgia, to tutor children in order to support himself. There he gained a reputation as man with a gift for invention.<br><br>In 1793, he returned to New England and filed the necessary patents to sell his version of the cotton gin but, unfortunately for Whitney, the money he expended in legal attempts to enforce his patents forced him to abandon the cotton gin business.<br><br>In 1798, knowing little about guns, Whitney bought the land where the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/a-separate-place-the-new-haven-colony-1638-1665/" target="_blank">New Haven</a> colony's first grist mill had been erected 150 years earlier, and he decided to go into the small arms business. At a time when American gun makers produced no more than 300 guns per year, Whitney obtained a contract from the US government to produce 10,000 muskets over two years. Overwhelmed, Whitney did not deliver the first 500 guns until 1801, but by 1812 he produced 1,000 to 2,000 muskets per year.<br><br>At the time Whitney began building muskets, the weapons were made individually by hand. The result of this process made each weapon unique, which meant that when a weapon needed repair, its replacement parts had to be handcrafted to fit that individual gun. Whitney focused on making a series of weapons with interchangeable parts. Other manufacturers adopted Whitney's methods and soon interchangeable parts and mass production became popular in other industries as well.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/north-and-south-the-legacy-of-eli-whitney/" target="_blank">More</a> on Eli Whitney<br><br><a href="https://www.eliwhitney.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Eli Whitney Museum and Workshop

The War Through Commemorative Prints<br><br>
The Kellogg Brothers of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a>, Connecticut, were among the most prolific printmakers of their time. In an era before television, radio, and the Internet, it was lithographs that often informed the American public's view of important historical, religious, athletic, and political events.<br><br>In the decades following the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a>, lithographic prints became a popular way for Americans to "see" some of the conflict's most memorable battles. Of particular interest were depictions of important naval victories. As a result, during the 1830s, 40s, and 50s, the Kellogg Brothers produced such popular works as Perry's Victory on Lake Erie and Combat between the Frigate Constitution and the British Frigate Guerriere.<br><br>The work of the Kellogg Brothers boosted American nationalism while also making the brothers quite successful. Through their own efforts, and partnerships with others, they became one of the most proficient decorative printmakers in America, surpassing the production of all of their competitors except the New York firm of Currier & Ives.<br><br><a href="https://chs.org/" target="_blank">The Connecticut Historical Society</a> houses the nation's largest collection of Kellogg Brothers' prints.

The Hartford Convention<br><br>
Many Connecticans viewed the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a> as an unconstitutional war which punished the New England states unfairly. At the time hostilities erupted, Britain and France were at war and preyed on American shipping. In an attempt to retaliate, President Thomas Jefferson pushed through the Embargo Act of 1807. It prohibited international trade at all American ports, which wreaked economic havoc in a New England.<br><br>In the years after war was declared with Great Britain, a movement began in the Northeast that pushed for New England's secession from the United States. In September, the Massachusetts legislature called upon the New England states to meet to plan a coordinated defense and to draft a formal protest against the federal government's continued involvement in the war. On December 15, 1814, delegates to the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-hartford-convention-or-leap-no-leap/" target="_blank">Hartford Convention</a> met at the Old State House in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a>.<br><br>What ultimately resulted from the Hartford Convention was a declaration calling on the federal government to protect New England and to supply financial aid to New England's badly battered economy. It also recommended new Constitutional amendments, including requiring a two-thirds majority vote in order for war to be declared. The Convention's final report was issued on January 5, 1815. Its timing, however, proved ill-fated. News reached the United States in January that on December 24, 1814, while the Hartford Convention was still in session, US delegates in Europe had signed the Treaty of Ghent which ended the war with Britain.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-hartford-convention-today-in-history/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Hartford Convention<br><br><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/osh/" target="_blank">Visit</a> Connecticut's Old State House

Nathan Starr<br><br>
Middletown's Nathan Starr provided cavalry swords and scabbards for the War Department after the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a>, making him the nation's first sword manufacturer. On May 18, 1808, navy agent Joseph Hull of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank"></a>New London negotiated a contract with Starr for 2,000 cutlasses. Increasing hostilities between Britain and France during the Napoleonic wars had brought about assaults on American shipping. With the likelihood of war looming, the US Navy ramped up production of gunboats, but the forces manning these vessels needed weaponry.<br><br>Starr's 1808 government contract called on him to produce a regulation navy cutlass for $2.50 and a pike for 75¢ to be delivered in four months' time. Starr produced the cutlasses (which were intended for use by the lower ranks) out of crudely forged steel, with a maple handle and a cup guard made of common sheet iron. Each cutlass had a straight single-edged 30-inch blade. The short blade, important for men fighting at sea, made the cutlass easy to handle as the men boarded and fought on the crowded decks of small vessels.<br><br>Starr's cutlass design saw heavy duty when the United States allied itself with France, sparking the 2½-year conflict with Great Britain that became the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a>. To help keep up with demand, Starr built a factory in 1813 on the Coginchaug River in the western end of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/middletown/" target="_blank"></a>Middletown. In the three decades that followed, the Starr enterprise manufactured 1,000 rifles; 19,000 muskets; 3,000 cutlasses; 22,150 sabers; and 5,180 swords. Some of these weapons are currently housed at the Middlesex Historical Society.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/nathan-starrs-cutlass-fought-the-war-of-1812/" target="_blank">More</a> on Nathan Starr<br><br><a href="https://mchsct.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Middlesex Historical Society

Raid on Essex<br><br>
The British raid on <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/essex/" target="_blank">Essex</a> in April 1814 resulted in the single greatest loss of American shipping during the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a>. Throughout the war, the British navy's blockade of Long Island Sound hindered trade along the Connecticut coast. Merchants in maritime towns such as Essex (then known as Pettipaug) suffered mightily at the hands of the British. As a result, some began arming their vessels and serving as privateers. Their efforts soon drew the attention of the enemy.<br><br>Captain Richard Coote of HMS Borer led the British raid on Essex, which involved crews mustered from four warships blockading <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a>. On April 7, 1814, the British anchored at the mouth of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a> and sent six heavily armed boats upstream.<br><br>As British marines secured the town, sailors set to burning ships. By the next morning the British had torched twenty-five vessels and made off with vital supplies. Their escape down the Connecticut River met with musket and cannon fire from both banks, killing two British marines.<br><br>The British raid devastated the local economy and nearly ruined a number of old shipbuilding families in town. Four months after the raid, the British bombarded <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/stonington/" target="_blank">Stonington</a>. Two weeks after that, they burned Washington, DC.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-british-raid-on-essex/" target="_blank">More</a> on the raid on Essex<br><br><a href="http://www.essexhistory.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Essex Historical Society

Battle of Goshen Point<br><br>
The Battle of Goshen Point resulted in the rescue of dozens of maritime traders along the Connecticut shore. It also proved an important victory for America's small gunboat fleet over a larger and more powerful British force.<br><br>During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a>, the United States relied heavily on gunboats to protect its shores. Gunboats usually measured about fifty feet in length, were single or double masted, and sported between one and three guns. For much of the war, the waters around New York City received protection from a fleet of fifty-three gunboats directed by U.S. Navy Commander Jacob Lewis. By way of comparison, the waters off of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a>, Connecticut, received protection from just two gunboats, though Lewis frequently ventured out from New York to protect American boats on Long Island Sound.<br><br>In April of 1814 Lewis led thirteen boats into the Sound to drive away a British privateer. Along the way he encountered forty commercial vessels requesting an armed escort to New London. Ensuring their safety meant engaging an enemy force led by the British frigate Maidstone and its twenty-eight guns.<br><br>Under constant fire, Lewis led his boats past the British, maneuvering in and out of danger and returning fire. The action broke off as darkness arrived. All the boats under Lewis's command eventually reached New London before the following dawn, at which time the commander of the Maidstone chose not to engage Lewis again, due largely, it appeared, to the damage Lewis inflicted the previous day.<br><br>The Battle of Goshen Point took place in the waters off (what today is) Harkness Memorial State Park.<br><br><a href="https://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&q=325214&deepNav_GID=1650" target="_blank">Visit</a> Harkness Memorial State Park.

Fortifying New London<br><br>
In America's earliest years, New London Harbor served as a vibrant commercial seaport, with merchants and ship owners growing wealthy off the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticut-and-the-west-indies-trade/" target="_blank">West Indies trade</a>. With the outbreak of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a>, fortifications along the harbor became paramount. In 1778 a fort, named after <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/jonathan-trumbull/" target="_blank">Governor Jonathan Trumbull</a>, was established on the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a> side of the harbor.<br><br>The urgency to keep the fort "battle ready" subsided after the American Revolution, only to re-emerge around 1812 upon renewed hostilities with the British. During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a>, the British blockaded New London Harbor, sending U.S. Commodore Stephen Decatur and his squadron of three ships scrambling up past the fort for security. Perhaps due to its fortifications, the British never attacked New London. Instead they chose (in April of 1814) to move up the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a> and burn ships anchored in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/essex/" target="_blank">Essex</a>. Four months later they attacked <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/stonington/" target="_blank">Stonington</a>---a battle witnessed by the men manning Fort Trumbull.<br><br>The fort that survived the War of 1812 was torn down in 1839 and replaced by the structure that stands on the property today. The site is now a Connecticut State Park.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/defending-connecticut-fortifying-new-london-against-the-british-in-1812/" target="_blank">More</a> on fortifying New London in 1812<br><br><a href="https://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&q=325200&deepNav_GID=1650" target="_blank">Visit</a> Fort Trumbull State Park

Stonington Battle Flag<br><br>
The defense of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/stonington/" target="_blank">Stonington</a> in the face of an attempted British landing represents one of Connecticut's most notable and unlikely successes of the war. The American flag that was raised in defiance of the British attack now resides at the Stonington Historical Society.<br><br>In the summer of 1814, the British planned to weaken New England's economy by blockading its waters. In addition, numerous planned raids threatened to either steal or burn American resources along the shoreline. On August 9th of that year, a British naval squadron commanded by Captain Sir Thomas Masterman launched a naval bombardment against Stonington in hopes of raiding the town.<br><br>On August 10th, during a short break in the bombardment, a man named Dean Gallup stood upon the shoulders of one of his comrades and nailed a large American flag to a pole in defiance of the British attack. The flag measured twelve feet high by eighteen feet long, was made of wool, and sported sixteen stars and stripes (despite the law of the time requiring it to have fifteen). It remained in place until the British sailed away on August 12th, having failed to land any troops ashore.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-stonington-battle-flag/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Stonington Battle Flag<br><br><a href="https://www.stoningtonhistory.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Stonington Historical Society
