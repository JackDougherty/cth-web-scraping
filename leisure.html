Examining How Connecticut's Recreational Spaces Reflected Changing Attitudes Toward Leisure Time
<br><br>

Candlewood Lake<br><br>

Candlewood Lake, in the towns of Brookfield, Danbury, New Fairfield, New Milford, and Sherman, is Connecticut's largest lake, but it did not exist before the 1920s. Where the lake stands now was once 5,420 acres of farmland, forests, and the small farming village of Jerusalem. The Rocky River, a tributary of the Housatonic River, passed through the valley and powered small mills beginning in the colonial period.<br><br>On July 15, 1926, Connecticut Light & Power Company's board of directors approved a plan to build a man-made reservoir for producing electric power. Water from the Housatonic River would be pumped into the reservoir through a thirteen-foot-diameter pipe. When needed, this water would flow back down into a turbine, which produced the electricity. It took Connecticut Light & Power twenty-six months to construct the lake, including building the dam. The project required 4,500 acres of woodland to be hand cleared. Some of the 1,400 laborers--many of them from Maine and Canada--were housed in four temporary work camps built at the site. In addition to the moving of graves and gravestones, approximately one hundred buildings, including schools, houses, barns, and churches were demolished or moved to clear the land.<br><br>On February 25, 1928, water was first pumped into the valley, and by September 29, 1928, the lake was officially complete. Once opened to the public, it became a popular destination for swimmers, boaters, and hikers.<br><br>More about <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/creating-candlewood-lake/" target="_blank">Candlewood Lake</a> and <a href="http://www.ctvisit.com/listings/candlewood-lake-town-park" target="_blank">Candlewood Lake Town Park</a>.

Quassy Amusement Park<br><br>

Quassy Amusement Park in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/middlebury/" target="_blank">Middlebury</a> is an enduring symbol of one of the more romantic and nostalgic attractions in modern American history---that of the local trolley park.<br><br>Trolley parks were all the rage in Connecticut in the early 1900s. Before automobiles became common, trolleys provided ordinary people with a way to escape the cities. The trolley from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/waterbury/" target="_blank">Waterbury</a> to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/woodbury/" target="_blank">Woodbury</a> reached Lake Quassapaug in 1908, bringing visitors to enjoy the lakeshore. The first dance pavilion was built on the site two years later. In 1915, this structure was replaced by a larger dance hall, the oldest building remaining on the site today. During the Roaring Twenties, dances were held there seven nights a week. The park also featured concession stands, a carousel, and boat rides.<br><br>The trolley line stopped running in 1930, and the park struggled through the Depression and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-ii/" target="_blank">World War II</a>. But unlike other trolley parks, Lake Quassapaug experienced a revival following the war. A Kiddieland was added in 1952, and other new rides included "Sky Fighter" jets and a "Saturn Six" ride. Though the park continued to be officially known as Lake Quassapaug Park, by the 1980s it was more often referred to as "Quassy," its affectionate nickname.<br><br>Today, Quassy remains very much family-oriented, classifying its rides as kiddie rides, family rides, or thrill rides. The historic 1915 dance pavilion now houses the Redemption Arcade offering everything from traditional games such as Skee-Ball to the state-of-the-art Quassy Quest Laser Maze. The 1927 roundhouse now houses Quassy's Grand Carousel, a new carousel installed in 1990. While Quassy continues to add new rides and attractions to appeal to its present-day visitors, it retains the feel of an old-time amusement park, a place for summer fun with friends and family.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/quassy-one-of-the-last-of-the-old-time-trolley-parks/" target="_blank">More</a> on Quassy Amusement Park<br><br><a href="https://www.quassy.com/" target="_blank">Visit</a> Quassy Amusement Park

Palace Theater<br><br>

Waterbury's Palace Theater plays a quintessential role in the narrative of early twentieth century leisure. Built during a time when largely urban populations sought out movie theaters as a low-cost form of entertainment, the Palace was the brainchild of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/sylvester-poli-negotiating-cultural-politics-in-an-age-of-immigration/" target="_blank">Sylvester Poli</a>, an entrepreneur who ultimately owned twenty-eight theaters and whose success rose alongside the popularity of movies and vaudeville in the Northeast.<br><br>Poli opened his flag ship theater in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/waterbury/" target="_blank">Waterbury</a> on January 28, 1922. His plan for the "Poli Palace," was to bring shows destined for Broadway to Waterbury. By that time, Waterbury was a bustling industrial city with a diverse population seeking respite from their long days in the factories. Poli provided that, and did so at an affordable price.<br><br>The first impression one receives upon entering the Palace is that of size. Not a pillar interrupts the view as the eye travels from the farthermost reaches of the auditorium to the stage. The whole great dome is borne up without the aid of intervening support, offering expansive views.<br><br>During the 1970s and early 80s many famous musical acts such as Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top, Santana, and scores of others performed at the theater. In the early 80s the theater went dark, however, and remained closed for eighteen years, despite receiving a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. But a restoration was undertaken in early 2002 and the theater held a grand reopening in November of 2004.<br><br><a href="https://www.palacetheaterct.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Palace Theater

Lake Compounce<br><br>

Lake Compounce in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/bristol/" target="_blank">Bristol</a> is the country's oldest continually-operating amusement park. The property was first opened to the public in 1846, when owner Gad Norton invited local scientist Samuel Botsford to conduct a series of electrical experiments on the grounds. Thousands of spectators attended the demonstrations, inspiring Norton to develop the property as a "picnic park." He built a path around the lake, added picnic tables, rowboats, and a gazebo for concerts, and also created a swimming area. In 1848, Norton added a hand-powered revolving swing and a ten-pin bowling alley.<br><br>The first trolleys reached the park in 1895, part of the emerging network of inexpensive public transportation which helped city-dwellers enjoy leisure time outside of the urban centers. Visitors today can still ride an open-air trolley car that served Lake Compounce in 1911. Also in 1911, Lake Compounce purchased a carousel from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/savin-rock-park-connecticuts-coney-island/" target="_blank">Savin Rock Amusement Park</a> in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/west-haven/" target="_blank">West Haven</a>. The carousel is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br><br>Financial troubles in the late 1980s and early 1990s almost forced Lake Compounce to close for good, but starting in 1996, new owners made significant investments to help put the park on solid footing.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lake-compounce-bringing-amusements-to-the-states-residents-since-1846/" target="_blank">More</a> on Lake Compounce<br><br><a href="https://www.lakecompounce.com/" target="_blank">Lake Compounce</a>

Elizabeth Park Conservancy<br><br>

Wealthy businessman (and State Treasurer) Charles M. Pond had a farm and residence in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a>. He raised cattle and horses and grew tobacco, produce, and flowers. Upon his death in 1894, Pond left 90 acres of his property to the City of Hartford for a park to be named after his late wife, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Park opened to the public in 1897 and is now on the National Register of Historic Places.<br><br>Swiss-born landscape architect Theodore Wirth was the first professional superintendent of parks for the City of Hartford and lived with his family in the upstairs of the former Pond mansion. Wirth created a central nursery in the park and had two greenhouses built in the late 1890s. Soon, the nursery was supplying flowers, shrubs, and trees for all the city parks.<br><br>Around 1903, Wirth designed and planted the Rose Garden, drawing on designs from Europe. Eight arched walkways, each planted with a different variety of roses, radiated from the center and attracted countless visitors each year. In 1911, one postcard company reported that it sold more postcards of Elizabeth Park than any other park in the country.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/poet-wallace-stevens-dies-in-hartford/" target="_blank">Wallace Stevens</a> lived nearby and composed poems on his daily walk to work at the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company. Stevens, who won both the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award in 1955, wrote three poems about Elizabeth Park: "Vacancy in the Park," "Nuns Painting Water-Lilies," and "The Plain Sense of Things."<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/elizabeth-parks-rose-garden-june-is-busting-out-all-over/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Elizabeth Park Conservancy<br><br><a href="https://elizabethparkct.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Elizabeth Park Conservancy

Wadsworth Atheneum<br><br>

The oldest public art museum in the nation, the Wadsworth Atheneum has been at the heart of downtown <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a> since 1842. It was founded by Daniel Wadsworth, one of the nation's first art collectors and a patron of artists such as Thomas Cole, Frederick Edwin Church, and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/john-trumbull/" target="_blank">John Trumbull</a>, whose paintings can still be viewed in the museum today. The original 1844 building by architects <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/echoes-of-the-old-world-the-architectural-legacy-of-ithiel-town/" target="_blank">Ithiel Town</a> and Alexander Jackson Davis remains an important example of the Gothic revival style.<br><br>The museum and its collections eventually outgrew the little Gothic castle that Wadsworth built. An addition in the Tudor Revival Style was funded in 1910 by <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/elizabeth-jarvis-colt-born-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Elizabeth Colt</a>, who also donated <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/samuel-colt/" target="_blank">her husband</a>'s collection of firearms, paintings, and decorative arts. The Renaissance Morgan Memorial was added in 1910-15 with funds provided by financier <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/j-p-morgans-connecticut-roots/" target="_blank">J. P. Morgan</a>, who was born in Hartford. The International Style interiors of the Avery Memorial, which opened in 1934, provided the setting for contemporary art collected by the Wadsworth's legendary director <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/chick-austin-modernizes-a-connecticut-institution-2/" target="_blank">"Chick" Austin</a>. Contemporary art has remained a major focus of the museum collections ever since.<br><br>A visit to the Wadsworth Atheneum today is a chance to experience a series of historic spaces as well as to view a major art collection that reflects the history of art collecting in Hartford and in America.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/hartfords-wadsworth-atheneum-est-1842/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Wadsworth Atheneum<br><br><a href="https://www.thewadsworth.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Wadsworth Atheneum

Goodspeed Opera House<br><br>

Goodspeed Musicals was the first regional theatre in America to earn two special Tony Awards, one in 1980 for outstanding contributions to the American musical, and a second in 1995 for distinguished achievement for a regional theatre.<br><br>The Goodspeed Opera House on the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a> in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/east-haddam/" target="_blank">East Haddam</a> opened to the public in 1877. Designed by Jabez Comstock and built by local businessman William Goodspeed, the building's main floor served as a store, office, and steamship docking point, and the top two floors served as a venue for live performances. After Goodspeed's death, the Second Empire-style building fell into disrepair and was used for a number of purposes, including as militia base during <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-i/" target="_blank">World War I</a>. In 1943 the State Highway Department purchased the building and used it for equipment storage. By 1958, the building was set to be demolished, but the following year concerned residents formed the Goodspeed Opera House Foundation in order to restore the building and bring back theater performances. In twelve months, $500,000 was raised and the State of Connecticut sold the building to the foundation for $1. The theater reopened in 1963.<br><br>Goodspeed Musicals has produced over 250 musicals since 1963 and has sent more than 20 productions to Broadway, where they have won more than a dozen Tony Awards. Over 70 world premieres include Irving Berlin's Holiday Inn  (2014), Amazing Grace (2012), Harrigan 'n Hart (1984), Annie (1976), Shenandoah (1974), Something's Afoot (1973), and Man of La Mancha (1965), all of which went on to Broadway.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/goodspeed-opera-house-opens-today-in-history/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Goodspeed Opera House<br><br><a href="https://www.goodspeed.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Goodspeed Opera House

Ivoryton Playhouse<br><br>

Originally constructed in 1911 as a recreation building for employees of the ivory-cutting firm Comstock & Cheney Company, the Ivoryton Playhouse has witnessed performances by such theater luminaries as Alan Alda, Don Ameche, Marlon Brando, Carol Channing, Phyllis Diller, Patty Duke, Faye Dunaway, Eva Gabor, Gene Hackman, Helen Hayes, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/katharine-hepburns-love-affair-with-connecticut/" target="_blank">Katharine Hepburn</a>, Groucho Marx, Ginger Rogers, Caesar Romero, Mickey Rooney, and William Shatner.<br><br>The theater was the brainchild of Milton Stiefel, a former actor and prominent manager and stage director in New York. Stiefel spotted the building on a visit to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/essex/" target="_blank">Essex</a> and decided it would make an ideal summer playhouse. The playhouse opened in 1930 after Stiefel put together a company--mostly his friends--called The New York Players. They lodged in private homes and borrowed most of their props and sets. In their first summer they barely broke even financially but Stiefel continued to produce and direct plays in Ivoryton, and in 1938, he purchased the building. The theater's reputation continued to grow and many actors soon prized invitations to perform there.<br><br>With the outbreak of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-ii/" target="_blank">World War II</a>, however, the theater closed for several seasons, and Stiefel went to work in Hollywood. He returned after the war and promptly reopened the playhouse.<br><br>Stiefel retired in 1973 but remained active with the theater until his death in 1983. In 1979 the non-profit Ivoryton Playhouse Foundation was formed to help protect the theater from demolition.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/ivoryton-playhouse-opens/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Ivoryton Playhouse<br><br><a href="http://www.ivorytonplayhouse.org/" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Ivoryton Playhouse

Rocky Neck State Park<br><br>

Rocky Neck State Park in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/east-lyme/" target="_blank">East Lyme</a> is more than just beautiful beaches and scenic marshes. It serves as one of the state's most popular Depression-era redevelopment projects.<br><br>In the nineteenth century, the land that is today Rocky Neck State Park was occupied by a dairy farm and a stone quarry. The New York and New London Railroad came through in 1852 and its track became the main line between New York and Boston. In the early twentieth century, the Niantic Menhaden Oil and Guano Company operated on the land, unloading fish at the long granite pier and turning them into commercial fish oil and fertilizer. That business went bankrupt in 1922, and nine years later the land was purchased by the State of Connecticut.<br><br>The purchase took place at the height of the Great Depression, with the stone for constructing the park coming from local quarries, and labor provided by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The centerpiece of the Rocky Neck project was the Ellie Mitchell Pavilion, sitting high atop a bluff overlooking Long Island Sound. More than 350 feet long and 80 feet wide, the pavilion was the largest Depression-era structure to be built in the state. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.<br><br>Today, Rocky Neck offers a curving crescent beach, miles of trails, plenty of picnic tables, a popular campground--and traces of its historic past waiting to be explored.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/abundant-wildlife-drives-the-history-of-rocky-neck-state-park/" target="_blank">More</a> on Rocky Neck State Park<br><br><a href="https://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&q=325256&deepNav_GID=1650" target="_blank">Visit</a> Rocky Neck State Park

Hammonasset Beach State Park<br><br>

Located along the shore in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/madison/" target="_blank">Madison</a>, Hammonasset Beach State Park is Connecticut's largest shoreline park and hosts over a million visitors annually. Native people called the area "Hammonasset," which roughly translates to "where we dig the ground." They fished and hunted and grew corn, beans, and squash here.<br><br>European colonists arrived in the area in the early 1600s, increasing competition for natural resources and bringing with them different ideas about land use and property. Treaties, transactions, and the fallout of war and disease increasingly brought the land into European hands. Into the late 1800s, the area continued to be used for farming and harvesting seaweed and salt-marsh hay.<br><br>Then, in 1898, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company purchased the land and used it to test new weapons, firing rifles at targets on the beach. After <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-i/" target="_blank">World War I</a>, the park returned to a more natural state, opening as a public beach and park on July 18, 1920. In its first season, it attracted over 75,000 visitors, but visitation sky-rocketed as an increase in automobile production made recreational activities accessible for more Americans.<br><br>The Parks Commission built a Grand Pavilion and boardwalk, and the park nearly doubled in size in 1923 with the acquisition of additional land. The park was closed to the public during <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-ii/" target="_blank">World War II</a>, when the federal government used the property as an army reserve station and aircraft range. In 1954, hurricanes and flooding significantly damaged the area.<br><br>Today, however, Hammonasset remains a popular destination for beach-goers and nature enthusiasts alike. Its success has also spawned the creation of additional state parks in the area.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/hammonasset-state-park-serves-the-state-and-its-residents/" target="_blank">More</a> on Hammonasset Beach State Park<br><br><a href="https://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&q=325210&deepNav_GID=1650" target="_blank">Visit</a> Hammonasset Beach State Park

Savin Rock Park<br><br>

The stretch of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/west-haven/" target="_blank">West Haven</a> shoreline known as Savin Rock was one of Connecticut's premier leisure attractions dating back to before the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/civil-war/" target="_blank">Civil War</a>. By the 1870s, its beaches were a frequent destination for excursions, accessible first by horse car and later by trolley and steamboat. The nearby Savin Rock Hotel hosted Civil War reunions, company outings, and political conventions, as well as gatherings of friends and families. People came to enjoy the sea air, good food, and perhaps a band concert.<br><br>Shortly after 1900, Savin Rock became a full-fledged amusement park, with a midway, funhouse, and rides such as the flying swings, "Shoot the Chutes," and a scenic railway. At night the whole place was ablaze with electric lights (still a novelty in the early 1900s) and its "White City" even recalled the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. As the years passed, more attractions continued to be added, including theaters, four merry-go-rounds, a roller coaster, restaurants, and by 1916, a parking lot with spaces for 400 cars.<br><br>The <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-hurricane-of-1938-rocks-connecticut/" target="_blank">Hurricane of 1938</a> and frequent fires took their toll on Savin Rock Park, however, and attendance fell off dramatically after <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-ii/" target="_blank">World War II</a>. As Americans took to the road in their automobiles in ever-greater numbers, the aging and increasingly neglected amusement park no longer seemed like a thrilling destination. It was ultimately demolished in the 1960s.<br><br>Today you can visit the <a href="http://savinrockmuseum.com/" target="_blank">Savin Rock Museum</a> in the Savin Rock Conference Center to learn about the history of the park. You can also stroll along the beach in West Haven where the park was once located and see why the site was chosen to be one of the state's premier attractions of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/savin-rock-park-connecticuts-coney-island/" target="_blank">More</a> on Savin Rock Park
