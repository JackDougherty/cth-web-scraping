Ridgefield - Main Street Architecture<br><br>

Orientation<br><br>
Whether you notice it or not, Ridgefield's history is illuminated by the very buildings that comprise the town. This tour seeks to explore prominent architectural styles in their historical context, as well as to highlight the colorful individuals who built and inhabited these living relics.<br><br>

Ahead of Its Time (316 Main Street)<br><br>

This iconic house was built in 1896 by Phineas Chapman Lounsbury, who served as Connecticut's governor from 1877 to 1879, and it is an example of the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Classical Revival style</a>, which reflects an early 20th-century interest in an 18th-century architectural past.<br><br>Phineas (a native Ridgefielder) along with his brother <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lounsbury-elected-governor-today-in-history-january-4-2/" target="_blank">George </a>(born in Pound Ridge, NY), established a shoe manufacturing business in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a>, which grew and became Lounsbury, Mathewson & Co. The Lounsbury House was ahead of its time as it was modeled after the Connecticut State Building at the 1893 Chicago Columbia Exposition, which drew inspiration from the grander houses occupied by the state's founding families.<br><br>Lounsbury boasts many of the hallmarks of a traditional <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Georgian</a>: a symmetrical <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">fa√ßade</a>, ornate detailing, an elaborate doorway, and neo-classical <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">portico</a>. As a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Classical Revival</a> these features are emphasized with a more modern touch. The interior floor plan of the Lounsbury House is not symmetrical as it would have been in a classic <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Georgian</a>, though all the rooms are still anchored around the entrance and grand stair hall at the center of the home. Other 20th-century changes include the extended center <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">gable</a>, exaggerated <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">dentil moldings</a>, and fitted wrap-around porch.<br><br>Afraid of losing the mansion to time and neglect, the Town of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> bought the property in order to build Veterans Park Elementary School. The house was then leased to be run as the Town Community Center, reviving the house to its former glory.

<br><br>

Bursting at the Seams (310 Main Street)<br><br>

The Hanneman House has been reconfigured over the years but was originally a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Federal</a>-style home, popular in the last quarter of the 18th century. The typical layout is one rectangular room, however, it was later expanded as the family started to grow. The classic <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Federal</a> house showcases five windows on the second story and two each on either side of the front door. Notice that of the two sets of columns on the facade framing the entry, the slender colonettes that are closest to the door are <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Federal</a> style, while the outer pair are Tuscan from a later date. The prominent full-width porch is clearly a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Victorian</a>-era addition, though the oversized <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">dormers</a> were added in the early 20th century.<br><br>The plot of land that the house stands on, Lot 8, was given to Samuel Smith who was nicknamed "Milford" so he wasn't confused with Samuel Smith of Norwalk. Milford Smith eventually became the Town Selectman in 1715. The Hanneman House was later owned by Charles Grumman and his wife Elizabeth R. Nash from 1841 until 1850 and then sold to Rufus H. Pickett. It was later acquired by Governor Phineas Lounsbury in 1876 who enlarged the house to shelter his twenty-six servants. The property was obtained by the Town of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> in 1945, and subsequently Carlyle Park and Denise Gorringe Hanneman, renters around 1949 to 1957, lent the house its current name.

<br><br>

Constant Change (304 Main Street)<br><br>

While this building may embody the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial</a> style today, the house has gone through a few different looks over the years, and even more owners!<br><br>The core of this house is thought to have been completed early in the town's settlement (circa 1802), but was later expanded into an extravagant <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Greek Revival</a> around the height of the style's popularity in the early 19th century. During this time, the home was occupied by David Hurlbutt, who ran a small meat market after which Market Street is named. Unfortunately, David met his end on the job in 1858 when a cow he was to butcher got the better of him.<br><br>After David's son, Sereno, died in 1904, the home was acquired by Dr. William Hanford Allee and his wife, Laura Curie Allee. William was an amateur architect and made a number of modifications in the early 20th century that changed the house to resemble a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial </a>rather than a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Greek Revival</a>. Laura was an active suffragist, who played a key role in getting the support of Tennessee, the last vote needed to make the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/19th-amendment-the-fight-over-woman-suffrage-in-connecticut/" target="_blank">19th Amendment</a> into law.<br><br>Outliving William, who died in 1927, Laura commissioned the building's final major remodel in 1941, cementing the building as a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial Revival</a>. While it is unclear when each specific feature was added to the house, the external shutters and low foundation are two major identifying characteristics of the style as is the asymmetrical and expansive floor plan.


<br><br>

Home Appreciation (250 Main Street)<br><br>

Built by Henry Hawley as a summer cottage, this <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Italian Villa Style</a> Painted Lady was constructed in 1826 according to the Assessor's Field Card and is one of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>'s earliest <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Victorians</a>. Though much of its original ornamentation has been lost, it still exemplifies the 'rural villa' style popularized in 1840 by A. J. Downing which completely altered America's colonial streetscape. Classic Italianate details include the bracketed entry, <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">bay window</a>, <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">pediments</a>, and small round-headed windows topped with Italian-style surrounds and projected sills supported by brackets.<br><br>The house was purchased in 1866 for $2,500 by Elisha and Daniel Hawley and was sold in 1872 to Henry Hawley's wife, Jane Elizabeth Lockwood, who lived there until 1891, when it sold for $15,000.<br><br>The house is painted in historically accurate colors, with Villa homes opting for the softer hues found in nature. Other features of the style can be seen in its projecting <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">eaves</a> and <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">verandas</a>. The house was purchased in 2002 by Gregory and Valerie Jensen who have continued its landscaping restoration. Traditionally the landscaping consisted of porch vines and naturalistic clumps of bushes and trees, with the foundation plantings being a much later development. Valerie Jensen is the founder of the Prospector Theatre, a non-profit cinema dedicated to providing a higher quality of life through meaningful employment to people with disabilities.

<br><br>

Living the High Life (236 Main Street)<br><br>

This small building happens to be one of the oldest structures in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>. Like so many other original <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial</a> buildings in town, additions were made over the years, but the only major one here was a kitchen wing completed around 1760, more than a decade before the founding fathers declared independence from the crown.<br><br>The first section of this building was completed in 1713 on the original Lot 5, where it still stands today. Constructed for the First Minister of Ridgefield, the home was occupied by Reverend Thomas Hauley shortly after his graduation from Harvard in 1709. In addition to being minister of the newly formed Congregational Church, Hauley also served as school teacher and town clerk. Unsatisfied with its humble construction, he paid ten pounds out of his own salary for a larger and more formal house.<br><br>The building diverges from the common <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial</a> features one might typically see in Ridgefield. It has two chimneys, one on either end of the building, rather than a single central one. The <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">gambrel roof</a> and extended <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">
portico</a> over the front door are features common among the Dutch colonies from the Hudson River Valley, making it stand out compared to the architectural norms in Ridgefield practiced during the same period. The interior, has been largely preserved for more than three centuries, including original broad floorboards, hand-hewn beams, and much of the hand-blown window glass.

<br><br>

Architectural Mashup (212 Main Street)<br><br>

Of all the buildings in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> with mixed stylistic identities and ambiguous completion dates, perhaps none are as confounding as the home of Elijah Hawley, wagon maker and great grandson of Reverend Thomas Hauley (the spelling was changed to "w" in later generations). This northern half of the original Lot 4 initially hosted a whipping post for colonial Ridgefield, where public floggings were doled out to accused criminals. The first record of a completed project on this property dates back to 1800, but given that it was part of the original Proprietary Lot Drawing, it is not unlikely that a structure existed here before the end of the 18th century. The following round of additions was completed in 1896, and the building has remained largely the same since then.<br><br>This building is officially classified as a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial Revival</a> by virtue of the low foundation and minimal outer ornamentation as well as the fact it was completed after the colonial period. However, it borrows a number of features from diverse styles. The steep <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">gable roof</a> speaks to the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Gothic</a> style that was popular during the turn of the 19th into the 20th century. The porch railing, meanwhile, is characteristically <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Georgian</a>, though the jigsaw design is more reminiscent of the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Carpenter Gothic</a> style. As if this building's style was not eclectic enough from the exterior, the interior has ornate stairs and cast iron stoves that were characteristic of the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Victorian</a> style that was popular during the second round of additions to the home.

<br><br>

Bigger and Better (188 Main Street)<br><br>

Built in 1787, the Czar Jones House is an excellent example of the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Federal-Georgian Revival</a> style. Its complex rooflines indicate the many additions and alterations made to the original structure which began as a modest <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Federal</a> style home, with side ell or wing and a picket fence.<br><br>Czar Jones was a woodworker and a justice of the peace, who served in the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a> and later was a partner in the local carriage manufacturing company. Jones bought the property in 1818 and it served as his family's residence until 1890. It was then purchased by New York City publisher, Albert H. Storer's wife Sophie, who was the founder and first president of the Ridgefield Garden Club. Intended as a summer getaway, the house became the Storer's primary residence ten years later. After their divorce in 1915, Sophie moved to Europe while Albert remained in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> with his son Francis, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren, until his death in 1933.<br><br>As popular styles changed, additions were built, enlarging the house far past its original structure and including many <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">20th Century Revival</a> elements. Some of these features include the addition of a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Federal</a> style portico and the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">Palladian window</a> in its west gable. The facade was greatly altered and adorned with a bank of small pane windows of 20th-century origins.

<br><br>

Best Laid Plans (152 Main Street)<br><br>

Cass Gilbert was a prominent American architect. An early proponent of skyscrapers, his works include the Woolworth Building, the United States Supreme Court building, and the state capitols of Minnesota, Arkansas, and West Virginia. He also designed the iconic neoclassical fountain on Main Street.<br><br>This 1930s brick structure was commissioned as a memorial museum and library by Cass Gilbert's widow, Julia, and was designed to reflect her husband's interest in <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Georgian</a> architecture (as seen in the building's symmetry). The space was too modest to accommodate Gilbert's massive collection of architectural materials, so they were sent to other institutions. It was then converted into a residence. In 1952 the couple's daughter, Emily Finch Gilbert, inherited the building and the historic Keeler Tavern, in turn passing it down to her children; the Gilberts lived on Main Street for over fifty years.<br><br>Some features which mark this structure unmistakably as a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Georgian Reproduction</a>, a modernized reimaging of the original style, are its equidistant chimneys, <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">keystone window ornament</a>, <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">oriel windows</a>, and prominent entry and <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">entablature</a>. The entry is adorned with a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">pediment</a>, which was a common component of 18th-century <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Georgian</a> architecture. The building is no longer a residence and instead serves as the Visitors Center and administrative offices for the <a href="https://keelertavernmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Keeler Tavern Museum & History Center</a>.

<br><br>

Danger Averted (132 Main Street)<br><br>

Arguably the most notable historical building in Ridgefield, the Keeler Tavern, stands as a relic of pre-Revolutionary America. This building, formerly the home of architect Cass Gilbert, passed through many hands over the years, most of whom made modifications and additions to serve their needs, but the tavern's soul remains <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial</a>.<br><br>In total, the tavern has two central chimneys, unique to the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial</a> and <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial Revival</a> styles. The four-faced, <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">gambrel roof</a> atop the largest section of the building is also a key identifier. Finally, while they may not have shutters, the paired windows on the flat faces of the house, and the dormers extending out of the roof, are both common features of <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial Revival</a> buildings. Many of these windows still have their original 18th-century glass panes.<br><br>A discussion of this building's architecture would be incomplete without mentioning the British cannonball that has been lodged in the tavern's fa√ßade since the height of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">Revolutionary War</a>. At the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/battle-at-ridgefield-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Battle of Ridgefield</a>, 1777, marauding Redcoats fired a cannon south down Main Street, from what is now St. Stephen's Episcopal Church. The ball sailed about a mile-and-a-half before coming to rest in this building's wall, where the artillery remains to this day. The cannon itself, abandoned after the battle, was also incorporated into the tavern by Timothy Keeler Jr. as a hitching post for his patrons' horses--that is, until it was dug up in 1801, to be fired in celebration of Thomas Jefferson's inauguration.

<br><br>

Tory Saves Tavern (114 Main Street)<br><br>

This home was built in 1740 (according to the Assessor's Field Card) originally by Benjamin Hoyt with many additions being made in the 19th century by Thaddeus Keeler II.<br><br>As the story goes, Benjamin Hoyt, a Tory, was able to divert British General Tryon from torching the Keeler Tavern during the April 1777 <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/battle-at-ridgefield-today-in-history/" target="_blank">Battle of Ridgefield</a>. In 1776 he had been imprisoned among thirty-three other <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> Tories in the 'Fairfield Gaol' and was only released a month earlier upon payment of costs. Hoyt was later forgiven for his Tory sympathies and lived in Ridgefield long after the war as a respected citizen.<br><br>Subsequently, the house has had many prominent owners including William Whiting, Editor of the Ridgefield Press (1879-1890) and Joseph Hubbard, founder of Radio Supply Company (1923-1927), among others. Over the years the house acquired the name 'Hearthstone' and is a great example of the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial-Georgian Revival</a> style.<br><br>Its <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial</a> roots are evidenced by its rectangular form built close to grade, its symmetric fa√ßade with symmetrical window and door configuration, and hand-hewn beams in the basement. The house also possesses more <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Federal</a> style features seen in its window <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">pediments</a>, hooded <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">portico</a>, <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">cornice frieze</a>, and leaded door lights, which were likely added in the early 1900s. Its Revival elements date from a still later renovation and include the massive <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">gambrel roof</a>, prominent central <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">dormer</a>, and <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">Palladian window</a>. The entire rear wing is a late 19th-century addition.

<br><br>

Trend Setter (54 Main Street)<br><br>

While the actual completion date of the first version of the mansion remains an enigma, records agree that it was likely built in the late 1800s by Dr. Nehemiah Perry Jr, third in a multigenerational line of medical professionals that served <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> for more than a century. Tour-goers familiar with the town might recognize this surname from the street that this house most likely bordered to the east, Perry Lane.<br><br>While elements of the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Georgian Revival</a> style have found their way into this mansion's identity in later additions, the home retains its <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial Revival</a> characteristics with its low foundation, shuttered windows, and wide-gable roof. It is unclear when the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Georgian</a> additions were made, but they were likely commissioned by one of two subsequent residents, circa early 20th century.<br><br>This was one of the houses that was part of a trend at the turn of the 19th into the 20th century: as New York City became increasingly industrialized, wealthy residents sought summer homes immersed in the verdant country spaces in and around Ridgefield. The DePeyster sisters were one such seasonal family, purchasing this home in 1895 and affectionately dubbing it "Knollton."<br><br>By 1931, the home found its way back into the hands of a year-round resident in Judge Joseph H. Donnelly. Ridgefield's first full-time lawyer operated his practice right out of the mansion. He is perhaps best known for his development of the Donnelly Shopping Plaza in 1959.<br><br>(Note: To reach stop #12, you will cross Main Street and turn right, back toward the center of town.)

<br><br>

Is There a Doctor in the House? (85 Main Street)<br><br>

Platt Brush (1804-1868), a woodworker that partnered with the Big Shop carriage factory, was the earliest resident of this house. It has a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Vernacular Revival</a> style, which shares a three-bay <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">center hall</a> configuration with the classic <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Federal</a> style. Vernacular means that ad hoc knowledge and interpretation of local styles and materials were used by the builder, as opposed to strictly dictated architectural standards. However, this one was rebuilt in 1895 after a fire.<br><br>If you look up at the house, you will notice the edges of the roof are slightly turned upwards and a big flared <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">dormer</a> display, a reflection of the popularity of Japanese design at the time. Other modifications include the central <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">dormer</a> and a rear wing that were built in the 1960s to accommodate medical offices.<br><br>The house was in a good location for a doctor's office. The first physician who established a medical practice in the house was Dr. Calvin Kendall in 1844. Kendall married Jane A. Roy in 1846 and two of his three sons became physicians. Dr. Kendall later remarried after his wife's death but when he passed in 1904 he was buried with his first wife in Ridgefield Cemetery's Scott section. The property was later occupied by Dr. Theodore Safford Jr., who bought the house in 1952, and then sold it to Dr. Patrick A. Neligan in 1958. The house continues to operate as a doctor's office today.


<br><br>

House Envy (127 Main Street)<br><br>

The Charles Franklin Hoyt House is a fine example of the decorative and textural <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Queen Anne</a> style which was popularized in England and reached its peak in 1880 to the early 1900s. This architecture was first brought to public attention in the Philadelphia Centennial in 1875 and quickly became fashionable. However, based on the shingling on the round tower, this house in particular displays the emerging <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial Revival</a> style, which came afterward. Look up and you will notice double towers with <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">turret</a> roofs. The house also showcases a spindle railing and a wraparound porch which are classic <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Queen Anne</a> features.<br><br>The builder and owner of the house, Charles F. Hoyt (1850-1926), was a successful farmer, laborer, and butcher. He and his wife, Martha Frances Studwell were charter members of the Ridgefield Grange. His father split the Main Street lots amongst Charles and his two brothers; however, Charles was the last one to finish building his home. Due to unclear tension between Charles and his brothers, they were not on speaking terms at the time his house was being built, leading Charles to purposely make his home larger and grander to tower over his brothers' dwellings.

<br><br>

Between Heaven and Earth (139 Main Street)<br><br>

This <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">High Style Italianate</a> home was built by Ebenezer Andrus Hoyt, a respected and well-liked member of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> community, who served as a member of the State Legislature from 1898 - 1899, was highly involved in other town functions, and was an active member of the First Congregational Church. He also served as vice president of the Ridgefield Savings Bank from 1909 until his death in 1923.<br><br>As a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">High Italianate</a>, this house represents a later version of the earlier Italianate form, maintaining features such as its veranda and arches, which over time became more shallow and segmented. Such features are visible expressions of 19th-century American interest in nature and the Victorian ideal; that of man living in harmony with nature.<br><br>This redesign was popularized from 1870 - 1880. The style sports a variety of recognizable features such as crowning the house with a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">bracketed cupola</a> topped with a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">finial</a>, more ornate brackets with finial drops, and projecting eaves.<br><br>The Assessor's Field Card build date, 1859, is unreliable because the Hoyts did not own the property until 1864. The circa 1890 date is a guess predicated on the timing of the building of its twin next-door by his brother Edwin. It is believed that Ebenezer built the house for his second wife, Mary Edmunds Beers, before they married in 1893. Ebenezer's first wife was Anna Maria Burr, who died only ten months after their wedding in 1883.

<br><br>

One Up (145 Main Street)<br><br>

Edwin Keeler Hoyt originally built this house in 1890 as a twin to his brother Ebenezer's neighboring home, a prime example of a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">High Victorian Italianate</a>. Edwin's house carries many classic features including roof <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">brackets</a> mounted more widely apart than in earlier styles, all set under a wide brim <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">eave</a>, and a shallow arch over the door. <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">High Victorian Italianates</a> tend to be square form with shallow <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">hipped roofs</a>, though the crowning windowed <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">cupola</a> is no longer here. As the story goes, the two Hoyt brothers had a falling out which resulted in Edwin removing the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">cupola</a> and v<a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">verandas</a> from his home; how this design choice affected his brother however is unclear. Many other design changes have been made over the century, including the addition of the entire front section, noticeable by its concrete foundation which stands out starkly against the quarried stone foundation behind it.<br><br>When Edwin died young without a will, his wife Lucy Lockwood and his brother Ebenezer were named administrators. Lucy raised her children here and sold the house in 1927 to Pennsylvania Impressionist Painter George J. Stengel, who remodeled the barn at the rear of the property into his private studio. Since 1937 the house has had three other prominent owners including Edgar Rapp, owner of Bissell Drugstore and David Weingast, former superintendent of Ridgefield Public Schools. The house is currently inhabited by <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>'s First Selectman Rudy Marconi and his wife, Peggy.


<br><br>

Not Like the Others (149 Main Street)<br><br>

At first glance, this building may look like yet another of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>'s old <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial</a> buildings, given its central chimney and low foundation. However, keen tour-takers may have noticed that the north side of this building has cylindrical <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">columns</a> and pronounced gable <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">pediments</a>, making it partially <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Greek Revival</a> style on top of its <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial</a> roots.<br><br>Details about the building's history are fuzzy, but the earliest portion of the structure assuredly dates back to pre-Revolutionary Ridgefield. The original roof on the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial</a> side was not built with a ridge pole, or a beam along the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">roof ridge</a>, consistent with building styles from the 18th century. In addition, some of the wood was still covered in bark, truly exposing its age. The <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Greek Revival</a> side was an addition made at some point during the 19th century, which is summarily consistent with the height of the style's popularity during the century's first half.<br><br>The first iteration of this building was officially completed in 1750, but it stands on Lot 20 of the original property drawings of Ridgefield, established in 1708. What's more, early Ridgefield records refer to Matthew Seymour, one of the original proprietors of town and owner of this property, operating one of two trade posts that engaged in commerce with Ridgefield's native Ramapo Tribe. If this structure has pieces of the original trade post in it, 149 Main Street is one of the oldest buildings in town.

Tudor Transformation (207 Main Street)<br><br>
(Note: As you approach the Ashton Croft Manor House, you will find it behind the church.)<br><br>

The 'Ashton Croft' Manor House, now called Wesley Hall, is part of the Jesse Lee Memorial United Methodist Church complex. The manor house has been modified several times which makes it difficult to pinpoint the building's exact architectural history. This house was originally constructed by Henry and Elizabeth Hawley circa 1892 and early images depict a steeply pitched roof and tower, which suggest that it was built in the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Queen Anne</a> style. The house was later sold to Matilda E. Ziegler in 1912, who reconfigured the structure to include <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">half-timbering</a> on the gables and upper story walls, changing its classification to <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Tudor Revival</a>.<br><br><a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Tudor</a> homes were extremely popular and made up the largest proportion of homes built during the first quarter of the 20th century, especially in the northeast. A period <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Tudor</a> house was primarily constructed of a heavy timber frame, infilled with an ancient building technique called "wattle and daub." Most <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Tudor Revival</a> style houses are stick-framed and the timbers are decorative.<br><br>Wesley Hall is no longer a residence but houses the Jesse Lee Day School and boasts a parlor, library, and meeting rooms. The school's namesake was born in Virginia and worked as an itinerant minister. He came to New England in 1787 and is renowned for spreading Methodism from Connecticut to Maine. He preached his third sermon in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> in 1789, and later held chaplaincies of the US Senate and House of Representatives during the period between 1809 and 1815.

A King Size Mansion (267 Main Street)<br><br>

After the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">American Revolution</a>, Lt. Joshua King settled in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> and built the King Mansion in 1801. The original style of this house was <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Federal</a>, but it burned to the ground in 1889 and was rebuilt in 1894. Fire damaged the house again in 1990, and the present structure was restored and enlarged from 2002-2004. The mansion is a great example of early <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial Revival</a> with <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Classical Revival</a> influence. The bay window on the second floor and tall first-story windows on the fa√ßade are transitional elements from the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Victorian</a>-era in which it was built. The Mansard roof section of the rear wing was repurposed from the Bailey Inn, which stood next door, after it was demolished in 1919.<br><br>Joshua King, originally from Bridgewater, Massachusetts, enlisted in the Connecticut Cavalry Regiment at the age of seventeen. He quickly ranked lieutenant and served under General George Washington during the battle of Yorktown and British surrender. King lived in the mansion with his wife Anne Ingersoll and their ten children. In partnership with fellow officer, Lt. John Dole, they created the King & Dole store, which sits opposite, and now houses The <a href="https://aldrichart.org/" target="_blank">Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum</a>'s administrative offices. The King Mansion was passed down to their eighth and only surviving child, Joshua Ingersoll King. The property remained in the King Family until 1920.

Formerly the Bailey Inn (293 Main Street)<br><br>

The Assessor's Field Card places the build date of the Bailey-Keeler House as 1870, but evidence points to it having been built much earlier (in 1857) by Lewis Bailey, a local merchant, banker, state senator, and proprietor of the historic Bailey Inn. Lewis and his wife, Anne Scott, lived in the house until their deaths in 1899 and 1896, respectively. Originally this plot was home to a large cabinet manufactory eventually converted into the Bailey Inn which operated from the 1890s until the building was demolished in 1919. Before it was razed, sections were dismantled, rebuilt, and attached to the King Mansion down the road. In fact, materials from the Bailey Inn were reused in many new constructions, including some on the property itself. For example, after their only child Arvilla married Samuel Keeler in 1888, the couple built a cottage in the back of the property where they lived until Arvilla died in 1933.<br><br>The house is Main Street's most textbook example of an <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Italian Villa Style Victorian</a>, exemplified by its square Italianate tower, paired round-headed windows, <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">bay window</a>, and <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">bracketed eaves</a>. The classic porch columns are elements inconsistent with the style and may be much later additions. The color scheme has also been altered from the original. The house now sports a much brighter fa√ßade compared to the more subtle earth tones that would have been popular at the time.

Rockwell Royalty (305 Main Street)<br><br>

This <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Queen Anne</a> house is not exactly like the last one visited on the tour. This house is more influenced by a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Neo-Jacobean</a> style; however, some similarities are the round tower, fish scale shingles and a wraparound porch. Although it is not seen, the interior of the house is decorated with wood paneling, spindles, and a hall fireplace designed with double flues to accommodate a small stained glass window inset above the mantel. The house was built in 1850 and occupied by Francis Asbury Rockwell, who was a farmer and a tin smith. The one thing that is modern on the house is the brick porch <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">balustrade</a>. After Francis passed away, his son Charles Lee, who became the director of the First National Bank in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/ridgefield/" target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>, began to use the Main Street house as a second home.<br><br>Charles's wife, Mary Louise Everest, wrote about the history of Ridgefield which then was published in The Connecticut Magazine and Ridgefield's 1908 Bi-Centennial Celebration. The Rockwell family was quite well known throughout Ridgefield; Charles's great grandfather was Lt. James Rockwell, who served in the Connecticut 16th Regiment in the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">American Revolution</a>. Charles was also a distant cousin of Mary von Waldersee, later a countess after wed to Prince Frederick who passed two months later, leaving Mary a wealthy widow. Mary became involved with German charities and befriended German Emperor Freidrich and Empress Victoria. Her sister then married a German Baron and in 1903 they visited their cousin Charles in Ridgefield.

Cute Cottage (321 Main Street)<br><br>

Ashland Cottage, referred to as the Episcopal Parsonage on the 1867 Beers Map, became the new rectory for St. Stephen's Church replacing the original 1838 residence which stood down the road on the grounds of what is now Ballard Park. The cottage was built circa 1850 and it appears that the entire house was built at the same time. Like so many neighboring homes on south Main Street, it incorporates different architectural motifs and its look suggests a transition from <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Victorian</a> to <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial Revival</a> styles. The house was purchased by St. Stephen's in 1852 and was used as the church rectory until 1889 when it was sold to New York businessman Horatio W. Thayer as a summer home. Over the years, the cottage has been a boarding school for girls and after <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-i/" target="_blank">World War I</a> a boarding house called "The Three Pines."<br><br>Defining features of <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Victorian</a> homes include towers, <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">bay windows</a>, decorative woodwork, and round angles; the majority of the exterior of the house has touches of the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Queen Anne style</a>. The house is described to be an "L" shape and has double <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">verandas</a> which were common in Virginia, but not in Connecticut. The <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">gambrel roof</a>, double windowed <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/categories/architectural-glossary/" target="_blank">dormer</a>, and wide window sashes were later additions from the <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Colonial Revival</a> design. The house was painted pink in 1953 to match the blossoms on the spectacular weeping cherry tree in the front yard.

East, West, Home's Best (325 Main Street)<br><br>

A premier example of a <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Greek Revival</a> building, 325 Main Street proudly displays its Hellenistic influences. The grooved---or fluted---columns and low entry steps on the front of the building are both characteristic features of <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Greek Revival</a> architecture. The capitals, or tops, of each column bear a four-corner spiral pattern that identify them as Ionic columns. This building also has a pediment--a squat triangular roof structure directly above the supporting columns that it shares with the greatest temples of Greek and Roman antiquity.<br><br>While this house is listed as having been built in 1869, some primary records suggest that its completion date may have been earlier than that. The Smith family, this home's residents in 1869, lived on this same plot for the preceding two decades. This is consistent with the height of <a href="https://ridgefieldhistoricalsociety.org/architectural-styles/" target="_blank">Greek Revival</a>'s prominence in America from 1820 to 1850.<br><br>Daniel, Eugene, and Henry Smith, generational residents of this home from the mid-to-late 19th century, also owned and operated the Ridgefield Shirt Factory in partnership with D. Smith Sholes. The factory was situated where the Ridgefield Fire Department is today and employed more than 1,000 seamstresses before the Industrial Revolution. These shirts became locally renowned for their unprecedented comfort and freedom of movement.
