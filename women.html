<a href="https://www.cwhf.org/inductees/harriet-beecher-stowe" target="_blank">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a> was an author and activist who earned international fame for her best-selling book, <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, which proved a vehicle for her to express the injustice she saw in slavery and to ignite a fire that propelled people to action in the years leading up to the Civil War.<br><br>Stowe was born into the prominent Beecher family of Litchfield, Connecticut, in 1811. After attending school at the Litchfield Female Academy, she studied and taught at the Hartford Female Seminary.

The Martha A. Parsons House<br><br>

When <a href="https://www.cwhf.org/inductees/martha-parsons" target="_blank">Martha Parsons</a> was just 23 years old, she decided to leave her home, family, and friends to take a job with Landers, Frary & Clark Co. in New Britain, Connecticut. This represented a brave move for a young, single woman of her time but Parsons was strong and independent and welcomed what others might consider a challenge. In just twenty years, Martha proved herself an asset to the Landers, Frary & Clark team and by 1912, was named executive secretary of the $2-million corporation, becoming the first female business executive in Connecticut's history to earn her position on the basis of merit.<br><br>Despite having earned her promotion, Martha Parsons was directed to sign her mail "M.A. Parsons" so that men would not know they were doing business with a woman. Parsons held her position until her retirement in 1919 at the age of fifty. At this point, she moved back to Enfield to live with her sisters in a home originally built in 1782 as a "dwelling for parsons" of the Enfield Congregational Church.<br><br>At the time of her death in 1965, Martha left her house to the Enfield Historical Society and set up a trust to maintain the estate. The museum features many antiques and works of art that have been there since before Parsons' death, including the famous George Washington Memorial Wallpaper. The museum is free and open to the public.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/a-pioneering-woman-in-business-martha-parsons-of-enfield/" target="_blank">More</a> on Martha Parsons<br><br><a href="http://www.enfieldhistoricalsociety.org/EHSMartha.html" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Martha A.

Windham Textile & History Museum<br><br>

Founded in 1854 as the Willimantic Linen Company, at its height (in the early twentieth century) the Willimantic mill was the largest factory in Connecticut and the largest thread mill in North America. It sprawled through nine separate factory buildings, two office buildings, a barn, three warehouses, and dozens of company-owned worker houses, which were arranged in three distinct worker villages: Iverton, the Oaks, and Carey Hill. Its massive buildings included the iconic Mill Number Four, the prototype of the modern factory building and at one time the largest one-story building in the world.<br><br>The company manufactured the first thread specifically designed for sewing machines, as well as the thread found in U. S. army uniforms, NASA spacesuits, and major league baseballs. The city of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/windham/" target="_blank">Willimantic</a>--located along the Willimantic River in the town and county of Windham in northeastern Connecticut--boomed as America's fabled Thread City.<br><br>While mill owners' wives may have thought their lives were worthy of notice, the stories of the less affluent women who worked in Willimantic's textile mills during the Industrial period provide compelling evidence of New England factory life. Visitors to the <a href="https://millmuseumwillimantic.org/" target="_blank">Windham Textile & History Museum</a> learn about women's lives, experience the contrasts of life in a mill worker's home and a mill owner's mansion, and can also tour a re-creation of a nineteenth-century textile mill.

<a href="https://www.cwhf.org/inductees/education-preservation/prudence-crandall#.XIkjErgpCUk" target="_blank">Prudence Crandall's</a> designation in 1995 as Connecticut's State Heroine reflects her courageous and unwavering commitment to abolitionism and education reform in the school she maintained for "Young Ladies of Color" in Canterbury--the first academy in New England for African American women.<br><br>Crandall purchased the Canterbury Female Boarding School in 1831. One year later, she became a pioneer in African American education and abolitionism when she admitted Sarah Harris (1815-1879), the daughter of a prosperous African American farmer, who had completed the district school and wished to be trained as a teacher. Angry community residents demanded that Harris be removed, but Crandall refused to comply and instead shutdown her school and opened a new one exclusively for teaching African American girls.<br><br>Crandall began to recruit pupils among middle-class African American families throughout the Northeast. Her steadfast commitment to the education of these young women was immediately tested by withering opposition from Connecticut residents who refused to tolerate a school for young women of color. Despite this hateful reaction, Crandall continued to operate the school.<br><br>In response, the state of Connecticut eventually passed the "Black Law," which barred the teaching of "any colored people. . . not inhabitants" of Connecticut without a town's permission. Crandall was arrested for breaking this law, spent a night in jail, and faced three trials. Her case eventually became a cause célèbre throughout the country.<br><br>Crandall's first trial resulted in no verdict, but in the second she was convicted. A third trial, which was an appeal before Connecticut's Supreme Court, overturned the conviction and dismissed the case altogether.

Thankful Arnold House<br><br>

The Thankful Arnold House transports visitors back to the early nineteenth century, helping them to explore the lives of women under the constraints of English Common Law. In particular, it focuses on the life of the widow Thankful Arnold and her struggles over the lack of women's rights to property in early America.<br><br>Because women, by law, were not allowed to own property, when Thankful's husband Joseph Arnold died prematurely, she was allotted only a third of her husband's property and the rest went up for sale. Luckily, her brother-in-law purchased the property and later sold it to her son, thus keeping it in the family.<br><br>The Thankful Arnold House Museum is a historic house museum located along the Connecticut River in Haddam.
