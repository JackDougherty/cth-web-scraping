Lyman Hall<br><br>
The one-time governor of Georgia and representative to the Continental Congress, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a>-born Lyman Hall is remembered most for his signing of the Declaration of Independence. He is also honored with the name of one of Wallingford's two public high schools, Lyman Hall High School.<br><br>Born in Wallingford on April 24, 1724, Lyman Hall was educated at <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/yale-university-from-colonial-times-to-the-present/" target="_blank">Yale</a> where he studied theology. He graduated in 1747 and joined the pulpit in a Stratified Parish that is now located in the city of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/bridgeport/" target="_blank">Bridgeport</a>, but trouble from many outspoken members in the parish quickly lead to him leaving the church in 1751 amid charges disparaging his moral character.<br><br>He learned after this that he was more interested in healing in a medical sense than healing through God. He completed his medical studies in 1754 and then married Mary Osborne three years later. The two moved to South Carolina where Hall was established as a physician in the town of Dorchester. After settling in Sunbury, South Carolina, his medical practices brought him enough money that he was able to obtain a rice plantation in Burke County, Georgia.<br><br>Later in his life, Hall became an outspoken patriot, arguing for independence from Great Britain. He became a delegate to Continental Congress in 1775. A year later he took part in the signing of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/wallingford-native-son-signed-the-declaration-of-independence/" target="_blank">Declaration of Independence</a>.<br><br>During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/revolutionary-war/" target="_blank">revolution</a>, the English destroyed Hall's plantation but his family managed to escape and join him in Philadelphia. After returning to Georgia, Hall became the state's governor in 1782. He served for one year and then went back to his life as a plantation owner. He lived the rest of his life in Burke County, Georgia, until his death on October 19, 1790, at the age of sixty-six.

Abraham Doolittle<br><br>
One of the first settlers of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a>, Abraham Doolittle was born in 1620 in England. He immigrated to Boston before eventually settling in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a>, Connecticut. Doolittle married Joane Alling, with whom he had six children and later, Abigail Moss, with whom he had seven.<br><br>In 1644, at the age of twenty-five, Doolittle became the chief executive of New Haven County and was also chosen seven times to be New Haven's deputy at Hartford's General Court. He became one of the first settlers in Wallingford in 1669 and two years later, in 1971, served as the town's treasurer and a sergeant in the "trainband," or militia. During <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/americas-most-devastating-conflict-king-philips-war/" target="_blank">King Philip's War</a> in 1675, Doolittle was a part of a vigilance committee, which was a group of citizens who grouped together for self-protection, fortifying their homes in the process.<br><br>Along with his time as sheriff and sergeant, Doolittle was also one of the thirteen organizers of the first church of Wallingford, and in 1681, served as one of four men authorized to purchase neighboring land from the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-people-of-the-long-water/" target="_blank">Quinnipiac</a>.

<br><br>

William Holt<br><br>
One of the first settlers of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a>, and the first Holt (or Hoult) recorded in North America, William Holt was born in 1600 in England. He lived there until he was thirty-five years old then set sail for Barbados. He relocated to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank"></a>New Haven around 1642. There he married his wife, Sarah, and they had seven children--five sons and two daughters. <br><br>Records show that he was living in Wallingford by 1673. He was in Wallingford for at least ten years before passing away on September 1, 1683, at the age of 83. His fieldstone marker is the oldest tombstone in the (then) new Center Street Cemetery. It is important to note though that he was not the first person to die in Wallingford, he was the first person to be buried in the new cemetery.

<br><br>

Katherine Miles<br><br>
Katherine Miles was born in England in 1588. Living there for most of her life, she came to North America and settled in the area that later became the state of Connecticut. While in Connecticut she married Richard Miles and together had one son. His name was Thomas Miles and he became a major in the army and married Abigail Mix, the daughter of Thomas Mix. <br><br>Katherine became the grandmother to Anna, who was the wife of Reverend Samuel Street. The Miles family tree can be traced back to a John Miles who came to New England in the year 1630. Richard Miles died in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a> in the year of 1663, one year after <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/john-winthrop-jr/" target="_blank">John Winthrop Jr</a>. acquired a royal charter to unite the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/timeline-settlement-of-the-colony-of-connecticut/" target="_blank">colony of Connecticut</a> with the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/a-separate-place-the-new-haven-colony-1638-1665/" target="_blank">New Haven Colony</a>. Katherine Miles out lived her husband by twenty years, passing away in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a> in 1683.

<br><br>

Rev. Samuel Street<br><br>
Reverend Samuel Street was <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford's</a> pastor for forty-five years, the second in the town's history after its incorporation. Before coming to Wallingford, however, he graduated from Harvard College in 1664 (in a class of only seven people) and married Anna Miles of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a> with whom he fathered seven children. With his father, Nicholas, Reverend Samuel Street then worked at the Hopkins Grammar School, which taught its students in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew classics.<br><br>Street was one of Wallingford's earliest residents, however he did not permanently move to Wallingford when it was first established. Instead, he waited for the chance to become its pastor, taking over for John Harriman of New Haven. (Harriman was Wallingford's pastor for its first two years.) Reverend Street's late move is believed to be due to Street's demands for proper housing and a salary of fifty pounds per year of service.<br><br>At the end of Street's ministry, a committee formed in order to find a proper replacement. They decided on Reverend Samuel Whittlesey who worked with Reverend Street in his last few years of his service. Samuel Street died on January 16, 1717, at the age of 82. His wife Anna followed in 1730 at the age off 91.

<br><br>

Mary Yale<br><br>
Mary Yale (1682-1703) only lived into her early twenties. She was one of eight children born to Rebecca and Captain Thomas Yale. In addition to being a captain, Mary's father served as the justice of the peace, surveyor, and a moderator of the town meetings.<br><br>Though she died young (outlived by both of her parents) Mary served as part of an important second generation of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a> settlers who remained in the town to secure their family's roots deep in Wallingford's history.

<br><br>

John Mattoon<br><br>
A second-generation settler of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a>, and a man who once owned an important section of land along Long Island Sound, John Mattoon was born in 1682 to Wallingford settlers Phillip and Mary Mattoon. He grew up in the family residence in the northeast area of the town, ultimately marrying a woman named Jerush Hall and fathering nine children.<br><br>In 1711, Mattoon bought half of a land plot belonging to a man named Robert Lyman. This land consisted largely of a series of forts and resided in what today is the town of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/branford/" target="_blank">Branford</a>. Just three years later, John sold this lot to his brother, Isaac. John Mattoon remained in Wallingford, however, until his death on February 19, 1754.

<br><br>

Capt. Caleb Atwater<br><br>
Born on September 5, 1741, Capt. Caleb Atwater once hosted General George Washington in his home and later helped settle <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/new-connecticut-on-lake-erie-connecticuts-western-reserve/" target="_blank">Connecticut's Western Reserve</a> (modern-day northeast Ohio). Atwater was the grandson of John Atwater, one of the earliest settlers in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a> who arrived there in 1682. Caleb married twice (the first time to Abigail Jones and the second to Ruth Wadsworth) and had eight children between them.<br><br>Caleb Atwater left his mark on Wallingford when he built two houses that still stand on the northeast corner of Christian Street and North Elm Street (in 1769 and 1779). When George Washington marched through Wallingford, he stopped at Capt. Atwater's house on Christian Street. During his short visit, Washington sipped tea and talked with Caleb and his family.<br><br>Caleb Atwater followed in his grandfather's trailblazing footsteps when he became one of the early settlers of Connecticut's Western Reserve. In April of 1799, Atwater left Wallingford with Jonathan Merrick, Peter Bunnel, Asahel Blakesley, and Asa Hall and arrived in what eventually became the township of Atwater, Ohio.

<br><br>

Deacon John Peck<br><br>

John Peck was the son of Deacon William and Elizabeth Peck of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a>, and his brother was the Rev. Jeremiah Peck who became the first rector of Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, a minister in Saybrook, and a founder of Newark, New Jersey. <br><br>John was born in 1638 and at twenty-four married the seventeen-year-old Mary Moss of New Haven. The two resided there until the settlement of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a>, arriving in town around 1668. Two years later John was given a house lot on the corner of High Street and North Main Street. <br><br>John and Mary had a total of 10 children by the time John passed away in 1724. The names of their children (Elizabeth, John, John, Elizabeth, Lydia, John, Ruth, Abigail, Anna, and Anna) are testament to the rates of child and infant mortality during the times in which they lived.

<br><br>

Nathaniel & Caleb Merriman<br><br>
Nathaniel Merriman was born in England in 1613, came to North America in 1632, and was one of the founders of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a> in 1670. He served as town clerk, selectman and first selectman, representative to the General Court, magistrate, and captain of the Train Band (local militia). He also served on many committees associated with the affairs of the town.<br><br>Nathaniel died February 13, 1694, and either he did not have a gravestone, or it disintegrated from weathering in the years after his burial. At a reunion held to commemorate Nathaniel's part in the founding and further development of Wallingford, his descendants dedicated his current gravestone and included on it his date of birth (believed to be June 2); a date probably not known at the time of his death.<br><br>Caleb Merriman was one of the founders of Wallingford and was born on April 25, 1707, into a very influential family as the son of John Merriman. Caleb was also the grandson of Capt. Nathaniel Merriman. In his will, Nathaniel left half of his land, house, barn, orchard, pasture, and corn land to his grandson Caleb.

<br><br>

John Moss<br><br>
John Moss was the oldest founder of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a> (at the age of sixty-six).

He then served as a deputy of New Haven for the Connecticut legislature from 1667 to 1670.<br><br>After relocating to Wallingford, Moss received an appointment as one of the town's commissioners, which essentially gave him judicial powers to solve disputes and to conduct town meetings. He helped organize the construction of Wallingford's church and served on a committee that acquired land from the indigenous <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-people-of-the-long-water/" target="_blank">Quinnipiac</a> people. This property included present-day <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/meriden/" target="_blank">Meriden</a>.<br><br>While no proof has been found, it is believed that, in 1704, Moss wrote his will at the age of one hundred. He died three years later.

<br><br>

Samuel Thorp<br><br>
While not one of the thirty <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/a-separate-place-the-new-haven-colony-1638-1665/" target="_blank">New Haven colonists</a> who signed the plantation covenant in 1669 to organize the Town of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a>, Samuel Thorp and his wife were one of the town's thirty-eight founding families, replacing some of the covenant members who refused to leave <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/"></a>New Haven.<br><br>Samuel Thorp was born in New Haven on June 14, 1646 and, at the age of twenty, married Mary Benton of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/guilford/" target="_blank">Guilford</a>. Upon arriving in Wallingford, the couple received a lot on the east side of the main road of Wallingford that they turned into a garden property. Thorp served his town as a sergeant in the Wallingford Trained Band before passing away on February 2, 1728. Thorpe Avenue on the eastern side of Wallingford is currently named after the family.

Rev. Samuel Whittelsey<br><br>
Reverend Samuel Whittelsey came to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a> to serve as a colleague pastor to the aging Reverend Samuel Street in 1710. When Street died in 1717, Whittelsey became the sole pastor, playing an important role in local political and religious life.<br><br>After his graduation from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/yale-university-from-colonial-times-to-the-present/" target="_blank">Yale</a> in 1708, Whittelsey helped further the Saybrook platform which set up a regional association of ministers known as "Consociations" and led to a tighter union of the colony's congregational churches. Whittelsey also admired the manner in which the Anglican Church was organized and kept order and was one of the first men in New England to sample the writers of the Enlightenment writers. He spread Enlightenment thinking to a number of Congregational Churches throughout New Haven.

<br><br>

John Hall<br><br>
In 1670, John Hall Jr, his father (John Sr), and two brothers, joined the company that settled the town of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wallingford/" target="_blank">Wallingford</a>.

Dr. John Hull<br><br>
Dr. John Hull's origins are unknown.

Civil War Circle<br><br>

The Civil War Circle has nineteen grave sites located in a circle slightly south of #18 William P. Smith.<br><br>On February 3, 1879, Congress authorized the furnishing of stones for the unmarked graves of veterans in private cemeteries. A list of Wallingford's Civil War Veterans was compiled by a local Veteran's Committee headed by Thomas Pickford. <br><br>On May 4 of that year, based on this updated list, Mr. Pickford sent to the Quartermaster General of the United States Army, the forms requesting headstones for Wallingford's nineteen soldiers in the Civil War Circle, as well as others soldiers located in Holy Trinity Cemetery and In Memoriam Cemeteries.
