Siege and Battle of Saybrook Fort (1636-1637)<br><br>

Tour Orientation<br><br>
Old Saybrook was home to the first established English colony and military fort on the Connecticut River in 1635 and the site of a six-month siege during the Pequot War of 1636 - 1637. The Pequot War was the first organized conflict between English settlers and Native peoples in the region impacting relations between these cultures for many years to come. <br><br>This Pequot War and Siege of Saybrook Fort historical tour guides you to twelve historical stops located throughout Saybrook Point, Saybrook Neck, Fenwick, Cornfield Point, Guardhouse Point, and Warehouse Point. We hope you will take the opportunity to experience and appreciate the historical and recreational value these sites provide. Although over 375 years have passed since the Pequot War and Siege of Saybrook Fort, visitors can experience the same scenic views and aspects of the landscape that would have been familiar to the earliest Native American and European inhabitants of the Saybrook area.<br><br>Much of the tour can be completed on foot but distant sites are accessible by bicycle or car and parking is available in specified locations.

Connecticut River Overlook (Vicki Duffy Pavilion)<br><br>
Native Americans of the region referred to the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a> as "quinetucket," or "long, tidal river" in the Algonquian language. The river was created over 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. Native peoples relied on it as a travel and trade route, as well as for fishing, and on the fertile lands on either side of the river for farming and hunting.<br><br>In 1614 Dutch explorer Adriaen Block was the first European to chart Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River. At the time of the arrival of the Europeans, the Western Niantic people lived in this area and were closely allied with the Pequot further to the east.<br><br>In 1624 the Dutch established a short-lived settlement on the point which they referred to as "Kievits Hoek." Dutch traders formed relationships with the Pequot who supplied wampum (white and purple, tubular shell beads) for European trade goods (metal tools, cloth, firearms). Through this arrangement the Pequot politically and militarily dominated Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River valley. The English took control of the point in 1635 and named the area "Saybrook" after two of their proprietors Viscount Saye and Sele and Lord Brooke.<br><br>The Connecticut River is the longest river in New England, stretching more than 410 miles over four states. A large, shifting sandbar is located at the mouth of the river and because of this navigational barrier the Connecticut is the only major river in the northeast without a commercial port at its mouth. In 1998, it was designated an <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticut-river-named-an-american-heritage-river/" target="_blank">American Heritage River</a> for its "distinctive natural, economic, agricultural, scenic, historic, cultural and recreational qualities."<br><br>Location: 150 College Street (Route 154).

Gardiner's Landing<br><br>
<a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lion-gardiner-helps-to-fortify-early-old-saybrook/" target="_blank">Lion Gardiner</a> (1599-1663) was born in England and was a veteran soldier and engineer, having served in the 30 Years War in the Netherlands. He was hired by the Saybrook proprietors to build a fortification and housing for "men of qualitie" in New England. In the spring of 1636 he arrived at the mouth of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a> to oversee construction of Saybrook Fort, where he served as commander during the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/pequot-war/" target="_blank">Pequot War</a> (1636-1637).<br><br>During the war, the area that today comprises Gardiner's Landing was a large, imposing, sandy hill or bluff overlooking the Connecticut River. With the river to the east, and Gee's Pond to the west, the hill made a good observation area.<br><br>The first fort built at Saybrook by Lieutenant Lion Gardiner burned in the winter of 1647, destroying most of the buildings and the palisade wall. A few years later, a second fort, known as Fort Fenwick, was built on the large hill where Gardiner's Landing is located today. A cannon platform was constructed atop the hill with barracks below.<br><br>Fort Fenwick was in use as late as the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/war-of-1812/" target="_blank">War of 1812</a>. The fort site was demolished by the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticut-valley-railroads-first-train/" target="_blank">Connecticut Valley Railroad</a> in 1871 and the hill was used to build railroad beds across North and South Cove. Today Gardiner's Landing is a small park which provides an excellent location to view the Connecticut River as it empties into Long Island Sound.<br><br>Location: 150 College Street (Route 154). Just east of the intersection of College Street and Bridge Street beyond the Mini-Golf at Saybrook Point. Public Parking available.

Saybrook Fort Monument Park and Overlook<br><br>
During the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/pequot-war/" target="_blank">Pequot War</a> (1636-1637) Saybrook Fort and Saybrook Point were the sites of a 6-month siege by Pequot warriors who frequently attacked the English garrison. When the siege lifted in March 1637, the fort served as the base of operations for Connecticut and Massachusetts Bay forces for the remainder of the war.<br><br>Saybrook Fort Monument Park is a 17-acre park which includes a 1913 monument to "Say Brooke Fort" along with a statue of Lieutenant <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lion-gardiner-helps-to-fortify-early-old-saybrook/" target="_blank">Lion Gardiner</a> sculpted by the noted artist William Ardway Partridge and erected in 1930 by the Gardiner family. The park was dedicated in 1985 on what was at the time thought to be the approximate site of the 1635 Saybrook Fort.<br><br>In 2012 the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center received an American Battlefield Protection Program grant from the National Park Service to determine where Gardiner's fort was located. After extensive archaeological work and historic research, they concluded that the fort site was on the northeastern end of Saybrook Point.<br><br>Both the Monument Park and boardwalk provide an excellent vantage to view the general location of Saybrook Fort further north. If one faces east from the viewing platform towards the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a>, visitors can imagine the original 1635 Saybrook Fort site situated on the highest ground to control the river below. Its design remains unknown but may have incorporated early Dutch designs such as a four-sided wooded palisade with at least two bastions, or redoubts, in which cannon were mounted.<br><br>Location: Intersection of College Street and Bridge Street (Route 154).

Cypress Cemetery<br><br>
Lieutenant <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lion-gardiner-helps-to-fortify-early-old-saybrook/" target="_blank">Lion Gardiner</a> oversaw the settlement of Saybrook Colony and the construction of Saybrook Fort. Following the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/pequot-war/" target="_blank">Pequot War</a> (1636-1637) the settlement grew to include all of Saybrook Point, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/an-old-saybrook-borough-has-a-stately-history/" target="_blank">Fenwick</a>, and the present-day towns of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/chester/" target="_blank">Chester</a>, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/deep-river/" target="_blank">Deep River</a>, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/essex/" target="_blank">Essex</a>, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/lyme/" target="_blank">Lyme</a>, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/old-lyme/" target="_blank"> Old Lyme</a>, and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/westbrook/" target="_blank">Westbrook</a>. It is believed that Gardiner laid out the Ancient Burying Ground, perhaps established sometime in 1636.<br><br>In the "September gale" of 1815, and again during the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-hurricane-of-1938-rocks-connecticut/" target="_blank">Hurricane of 1938</a>, the southern end of the cemetery along South Cove washed away exposing ancient Indian burial sites. The earliest European burials may include English casualties from the Siege of Saybrook Fort (September 1636-1637) and are thought to be located under College Street as the cemetery once extended further north.<br><br>In 1637, Colonel George Fenwick became the second governor of Saybrook Colony (after <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/john-winthrop-jr/" target="_blank">John Winthrop, Jr</a>.). His wife, Lady Fenwick, raised a garden with fruit trees and hunted small game. She died after giving birth to her daughter and was buried on a small knoll called Burial Hill.<br><br>In 1644 Fenwick agreed to sell the fort along with the Saybrook Colony patent to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/timeline-settlement-of-the-colony-of-connecticut/" target="_blank">Connecticut Colony</a> upriver before returning to England. In 1870 Lady Fenwick's remains were moved to their current location at Cypress Cemetery. The hill was leveled during railroad construction for the Connecticut Valley Railroad Roundhouse and Turntable site which still marks the location. There are two historic markers at Cypress Cemetery that provide additional information about the Cemetery and about the founding of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/yale-university-from-colonial-times-to-the-present/" target="_blank">Yale College</a>.<br><br>Location: Intersection of College Street and Cromwell Avenue. It is a short walk from Public Parking located at Saybrook Fort Monument Park.

<br><br>

Saybrook Fort and Wharf<br><br>
The Saybrook Fort Warehouse and Wharf site is believed to be the location of the first local docking area where small ships could offload their cargo to store in a nearby warehouse. Here goods were stored for local traders, such as William Pynchon and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/john-winthrop-jr/" target="_blank">John Winthrop, Jr</a>. The site was situated on a small peninsula extending toward the river. A large portion of the peninsula was removed for fill when the railroad was constructed in 1871. At the time of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/pequot-war/" target="_blank">Pequot War</a> the fort's wharf was most likely situated somewhere along the northeast corner of Saybrook Point. North Cove provided a protected harbor deep enough for smaller vessels to dock and unload cargo.<br><br>The existence of a concentration of ballast flint from European ships is believed to mark the presence of a seventeenth-century wharf. Unlike the Saybrook Fort site, the artifacts recovered from the Wharf and Warehouse site are primarily military (molten lead, lead sheet and bar stock, musket balls) and architectural (rose head and hand wrought nails, molten lead). Domestic artifacts (spoons, kaolin pipe fragments, ceramics) were less common. This pattern could reflect a Pequot War-era signature, as far less commerce took place during the war and fighting frequently occurred in this area during the Pequot siege.<br><br>Location: There is limited on street parking near the Connecticut River Public Access entrance at the Cromwell Avenue and North Cove Road. Walk the Public Access path to view the river.

<br><br>

North Cove<br><br>
Beginning in the early colonial days, and remaining through the early twentieth century, the many docks and wharves of North Cove served as the principal trading area for the exchange of goods to and from Saybrook Point to ports in the West Indies and elsewhere. At the time of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/pequot-war/" target="_blank">Pequot War</a> (1636-1637), the Saybrook Fort's dock and warehouses were located to the northeast of Saybrook Point and accessible from North Cove. <br><br>North Cove is an embayment, or a semi-enclosed body of coastal water, where fresh water from the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-connecticut-river/" target="_blank">Connecticut River</a> reduces the concentration of salt water. The lower Connecticut River contains one of the largest tidal marsh systems in the United States, and the most pristine in New England.<br><br>The remnants of the local railroad (constructed in 1871) that traversed the perimeter of North Cove, along with many homes of the early sea captains still remain and form one of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/old-saybrook-2/" target="_blank">Old Saybrook's</a> most historic areas.<br><br>Location: Old Saybrook Town Launching Ramp, North Cove Road.

February 22, 1637 Neck Fight<br><br>
Near this site, on the afternoon of February 22, 1637, Lieutenant <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lion-gardiner-helps-to-fortify-early-old-saybrook/" target="_blank">Lion Gardiner</a>, ten soldiers, and two mastiff hounds were ambushed by over seventy Pequot warriors. On that day Gardiner and his men ventured a half mile west of the fort to cut reeds and roll fallen trees to the waterside to float them closer to the fort. Pequot warriors waited in ambush and when the soldiers began burning reeds on Saybrook Neck, a few of the Pequot ran from the reeds hoping the English would give chase, which they did. Gardiner and his few men were quickly attacked by a superior Pequot force. Soon two English soldiers lay dead while the rest retreated east and fought their way back toward the protection of Saybrook Fort.<br><br>Gardiner's men exchanged fire with the Pequot many times between Saybrook Neck and Saybrook Fort, which created a path of dropped artifacts for future archaeologists to find. At Saybrook Neck, archaeologists located impacted and dropped musket balls, which mark the positions of both Pequot and English battle positions. Buckle fragments, dropped buttons, and broken musket parts all attest to the fighting that took place on the afternoon of February 22, 1637.<br><br>Location: One half mile south of the Old Saybrook Historical Society on Main Street at the narrow part of Saybrook Neck, near 500 Main Street (Route 154). An historic marker at this site provides information about the Neck Fight. Looking west (across the road) from this marker it is easy to see the extent of the marsh where this conflict occurred.<br><br>

<br><br>

Cornfield Point<br><br>
Lieutenant <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lion-gardiner-helps-to-fortify-early-old-saybrook/" target="_blank">Lion Gardiner</a> arrived at Saybrook Point on April 1, 1636, with the task of building fortifications and laying out a settlement. Gardiner ordered his men to plant three acres of corn to provide the fort with food. They planted the corn nearly two miles to the south at an area known today as Cornfield Point.<br><br>Why Gardiner chose a location so far from the fort is unclear, but it is likely Cornfield Point had already been cleared by the Western Niantic Indians who lived in the area and recently sold land to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/john-winthrop-jr/" target="_blank">John Winthrop, Jr</a>. and the Saybrook Colony. Gardiner understood how exposed the cornfields could be in times of war and therefore built a small, fortified blockhouse to protect them. The blockhouse was located at present-day Guardhouse Point (approximately a half mile to the east).<br><br>In September 1636 Massachusetts Bay forces attacked the Pequot and Western Niantic villages located along the Pequot (Thames) River in retaliation for the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/causes-of-the-pequot-war/" target="_blank">death of two English traders</a>. Understanding that the English attack on the Pequot was an act of war, Gardiner sent soldiers to protect the blockhouse and to guard the fields until the corn could be gathered. Following a successful Pequot ambush against the soldiers at the cornfield, however, the survivors were evacuated to Saybrook Fort. The Pequot then destroyed both the cornfields and blockhouse. <br><br>Location: There is limited Public Parking available at the Cornfield Point Scenic Overlook located at the end of Hartlands Drive which provides a pleasant view of Long Island Sound. Guardhouse Point is approximately a half mile to the east.

<br><br>

Guardhouse Point<br><br>
When Lieutenant <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lion-gardiner-helps-to-fortify-early-old-saybrook/" target="_blank">Lion Gardiner</a> arrived at Saybrook Point in April 1636 he oversaw construction of Saybrook Fort and a smaller fortified structure, known as a blockhouse, near this area known today as Guardhouse Point. The small blockhouse was likely built of rough logs and located almost two miles from the fort. It was designed to protect several acres of cornfield needed to supply the inhabitants at the Saybrook Fort garrison.<br><br>In September 1636, the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/pequot-war/" target="_blank">Pequot War</a> began following an attack by Massachusetts Bay forces on Pequot and Western Niantic villages located along the Pequot (Thames) River. The attack came in retaliation for the death of two English traders in the region.<br><br>Understanding that the English attack on the Pequot would result in war, Gardiner quickly sent five men to guard the fields and gather corn which he planned to collect the next day. Against orders, three of the soldiers stationed at the blockhouse went bird hunting nearly a mile away. The Pequot ambushed these men on their return to the blockhouse, killing two. According to one account, one wounded soldier "did with his naked Sword escape through them to the house" to tell the others of the attack.<br><br>The next day Gardiner sent a small detachment of men to evacuate the surviving soldiers by boat and gather what corn they could. As the men rowed back to the fort, the Pequots burned the abandoned blockhouse and tightened their siege on Saybrook Fort. The exact location of the guardhouse remains unknown.<br><br>Location: There is no Public Parking. Following Maple Avenue (Route 154), Guardhouse Point is located along the shoreline, approximately marked by Knollwood Beach. Cornfield Point is approximately a half mile to the west.

<br><br>

South Cove<br><br>
A short distance south of the Saybrook Fort site is the causeway crossing South Cove. At the time of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/pequot-war/" target="_blank">Pequot War</a> (1636-1637), South Cove was too shallow for any large European ship, but it could accommodate littler craft such as canoes or small boats. Crossing South Cove by boat was the quickest and safest route for English soldiers at Saybrook Fort to reach their cornfields. Following the attack on the small English garrison stationed near present-day Guardhouse Point, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lion-gardiner-helps-to-fortify-early-old-saybrook/" target="_blank">Lieutenant Gardiner</a> evacuated the survivors and returned by boat across South Cove.<br><br>The causeway crosses the South Cove embayment, a semi-enclosed body of coastal water. The embayment's brackish waters are home to shellfish, finfish, and waterfowl and provide an aquatic nursery and shelter for many wildlife species. Both the Native American inhabitants of the point, and later European settlers, relied on these resources for survival.<br><br>After the Borough of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/an-old-saybrook-borough-has-a-stately-history/" target="_blank">Fenwick</a> was established in the 1870s, a wooden plank bridge provided a way to cross South Cove. The causeway was then constructed by the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticut-valley-railroads-first-train/" target="_blank">Connecticut Valley Railroad</a> to reach the Fenwick railroad station and used until 1916 when the railbed was paved for vehicular traffic.<br><br>Location: Bridge Street (Route 154), just south of Saybrook Point Inn and the Saybrook Fort Monument Park. Limited Public Parking is available to the south on the Fenwick side of the causeway. This location provides a safe stopping and viewing point. A grove across the street at the Fenwick Golf Club offers picnic tables and easy viewing of South Cove.

<br><br>

Warehouse Point<br><br>
By September 1636, the Pequot were at war with the English at Saybrook and elsewhere. Despite his best efforts, Lieutenant <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/lion-gardiner-helps-to-fortify-early-old-saybrook/" target="_blank">Lion Gardiner</a> had difficulties protecting the remote buildings located at Warehouse Point from attack by the Pequot. (The buildings resided several miles north of the fort and not far from the area known today as Ferry Point). These warehouses were built by English traders who lived upriver in the towns of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/wethersfield/" target="_blank">Wethersfield</a>, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/" target="_blank">Hartford</a>, and <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/windsor/" target="_blank">Windsor</a>.<br><br>Shortly after the Pequot attack at Cornfield Point and the destruction of the blockhouse at Guardhouse Point, Gardiner ordered his men to move the contents of the warehouses into the fort. He observed that the "next day after I had taken the goods out before the sun was quite down...all them houses were on fire in one Instant."<br><br>When Gardiner and his men later rowed north to Warehouse Point they found everything destroyed. Pequot forces then tried to draw his men into battle, but Gardiner refused. For the remaining months of the Pequot siege, the English stayed within the confines of Saybrook Fort awaiting reinforcements. Warehouse Point would not be used again by the English until the end of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/pequot-war/" target="_blank">Pequot War</a> (in the summer of 1637).<br><br>Location: There is Public Parking at the Baldwin Bridge State Boat Launch located under the I-95 Bridge on Ferry Road. There is no direct access to Warehouse Point in Old Saybrook. The area at and around the State Boat Launch site provides access to the Connecticut River and visibility of the shoreline.<br><br>(To reach Warehouse Point and avoid travel on I-95, head north out of town and turn right onto the Boston Post Road. Turn right at the traffic light (Mystic Market on left) and continue (Boston Post Road becomes Ferry Road) for approximately two miles until you come to the I-95 underpass and the state boat launch site. Warehouse Point can be viewed from this boat launch site under the I-95 bridge.)
