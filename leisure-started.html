Candlewood Lake
<br><br>
Candlewood Lake, in the towns of Brookfield, Danbury, New Fairfield, New Milford, and Sherman, is Connecticut's largest lake, but it did not exist before the 1920s. Where the lake stands now was once 5,420 acres of farmland, forests, and the small farming village of Jerusalem. The Rocky River, a tributary of the Housatonic River, passed through the valley and powered small mills beginning in the colonial period.<br><br>On July 15, 1926, Connecticut Light & Power Company's board of directors approved a plan to build a man-made reservoir for producing electric power. Water from the Housatonic River would be pumped into the reservoir through a thirteen-foot-diameter pipe. When needed, this water would flow back down into a turbine, which produced the electricity. It took Connecticut Light & Power twenty-six months to construct the lake, including building the dam. The project required 4,500 acres of woodland to be hand cleared. Some of the 1,400 laborers--many of them from Maine and Canada--were housed in four temporary work camps built at the site. In addition to the moving of graves and gravestones, approximately one hundred buildings, including schools, houses, barns, and churches were demolished or moved to clear the land.<br><br>On February 25, 1928, water was first pumped into the valley, and by September 29, 1928, the lake was officially complete. Once opened to the public, it became a popular destination for swimmers, boaters, and hikers.<br><br>More about <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/creating-candlewood-lake/" target="_blank">Candlewood Lake</a> and <a href="http://www.ctvisit.com/listings/candlewood-lake-town-park" target="_blank">Candlewood Lake Town Park</a>.
