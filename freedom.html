Prudence Crandall Museum<br><br>

<a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/prudence-crandall/" target="_blank">Prudence Crandall</a> was a Connecticut teacher jailed for teaching African American girls in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/canterbury/" target="_blank">Canterbury</a>. Her arrest received national attention and brought greater awareness to the struggle for equality in education.<br><br>Crandall (1803-1890) was born in Rhode Island in 1803 and moved to Canterbury, Connecticut, at age ten. Because her parents were Quakers and had a belief in gender and racial equality, Prudence received an extensive education--one that was not common for girls at that time.<br><br>After completing her education, Prudence opened an all-girls school in Canterbury in 1831, where she educated the daughters of the town's elite. In 1832, Sarah Harris, a young African American woman approached Crandall about attending and Crandall admitted her. Many parents were furious and withdrew their daughters from the school. The following year, Crandall closed her school to white students and reopened a new one exclusively "for young Ladies and Little misses of color." It was the first private academy for African American girls and women in New England and Crandall's students came from nearby states as well as Connecticut.<br><br>In response, the state of Connecticut passed the Black Law in 1833, making it illegal for African Americans to enter the state to receive an education. Crandall continued to teach her students and was jailed and convicted under this law, but on appeal her case was dismissed on a technicality.<br><br>Crandall closed the school in 1834 when it was vandalized by a violent mob. Shortly before the school was attacked, she married abolitionist Baptist minister Calvin Philleo and moved to New York, and later Illinois and Kansas, where she continued to teach and work for social justice. In 1886, Connecticut provided Crandall with a pension, to compensate for the loss of her livelihood.<br><br>Crandall's effort to provide equal education for African American women in this house was unusual for the early 1800s. Her actions helped solidify attitudes against slavery throughout New England.<br><br>In 1995, Crandall was designated as Connecticut's <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/state-heroine-prudence-crandall/" target="_blank">state heroine</a>. The Prudence Crandall Museum, located in the Canterbury school house, is a National Historic Landmark and State Archaeological Preserve, located in the northeastern portion of Connecticut at the junction of State routes 14 and 169.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/prudence-crandall-fights-for-equal-access-to-education/" target="_blank">More</a> on Prudence Crandall<br><br><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DECD/Content/Historic-Preservation/04_State_Museums/Prudence-Crandall-Museum" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Prudence Crandall Museum

Old Windham County Courthouse<br><br>

The Old Windham County Courthouse is the site of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/prudence-crandall/" target="_blank">Prudence Crandall</a> trial during which she was charged with educating African Americans from outside of Connecticut. The "Black Law" that prohibited such education, the debate over whether the law itself was constitutional, and the outcome of the trial are a testament to the mounting abolitionist sentiment in Connecticut at that time as well as to the presence of a growing free black population and the lingering pushback against integration many of them experienced.<br><br>After reading several publications devoted to the advancement of people of color in the United States, Prudence Crandall visited William Lloyd Garrison in Boston to discuss her idea of opening a school for African American girls. She then traveled to New York where she found further encouragement for her idea of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/prudence-crandall-fights-for-equal-access-to-education/" target="_blank">opening a school</a> for young women and girls of color.<br><br>As girls between the ages of nine and twenty-two from Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, and Philadelphia began attending the school, Crandall experienced hostility from local residents. In 1833, as a reaction to Crandall's school, the state of Connecticut passed a law forbidding the education of people of color from outside the state because it "would tend to the great increase of the colored population of the State, and thereby to the injury of the people."<br><br>Approximately six weeks after the passage of the law, a lawsuit was filed against Prudence Crandall by the state and she was jailed overnight. She was tried in the county courthouse on August 23, 1833, and was eventually set free.<br><br>The courthouse is located at 4 Wolf Den Road, the current Town Hall in Brooklyn.

Connecticut's Old State House<br><br>

A bustling state capitol for 83 years, Connecticut's Old State House witnessed legislation, trials, and debates on countless issues that touched the lives of every Connectican.<br><br>In 1818, leaders created a state Constitution that changed Connecticut's governance in many ways. While it granted voting rights to a broader range of white men, it disenfranchised black men, despite their petitions for "no taxation without representation."<br><br>In 1833, the building saw passage of the Black Law. Designed to block <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/prudence-crandall-fights-for-equal-access-to-education/" target="_blank">Prudence Crandall's School for Colored Misses</a> in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/canterbury/" target="_blank">Canterbury</a>, the law forbade schools to admit students of color from other states without their town's approval. Crandall defiantly opened the school, was jailed, and tried. In the Old State House Courtroom, the Supreme Court dismissed the case on a technicality. Rallied by neighbor Andrew Judson, people harassed Crandall and her students until she closed the school.<br><br>The next year, Crandall's chief tormentor, Andrew Judson, presided in the famous <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-amistad/" target="_blank">Amistad</a> case. In 1839 and 1840, the judge heard arguments at the Old State House and in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a>. Africans Cinque, Bau, and others told their stories of capture and rebellion in court as part of their quest for freedom. Judson ruled in their favor. Saying that they had been illegally enslaved, he declared them free. The U. S. Supreme Court upheld his decision in 1841.<br><br>In 1865, Representative <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/people/p-t-barnum/" target="_blank">P. T. Barnum</a> served in the Old State House. He joined the fight to amend Connecticut's 1818 Constitution so that black men could vote. After delivering a rousing speech in the House, he and others approved the amendment. Connecticut voters--white and male--voted it down, delaying the reinstatement of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/no-taxation-without-representation-black-voting-in-connecticut/" target="_blank">black suffrage in Connecticut</a> until the ratification of the U.S. Constitution's 15th amendment in 1870.<br><br>Connecticut's Old State House, located at 800 Main Street, is a National Historic Landmark.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/video-old-state-house/" target="_blank">More</a> on Connecticut's Old State House<br><br><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/osh/" target="_blank">Visit</a> Connecticut's Old State House

Cross Street A.M.E. Zion Church<br><br>

The Cross Street A.M.E. Zion Church was founded in 1823 and it is the oldest African American church in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/middletown/" target="_blank">Middletown</a>. Since its establishment, the church has played an important role in the fight for racial equality.<br><br>The church building itself was erected for the congregation in 1830. Its preacher, Reverend Jehiel Beman, was an abolitionist leader and the church likely served as a stop on the Underground Railroad.<br><br>The African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Zion Church movement began in New York City and Philadelphia in 1796 when African Americans in both cities felt they needed to break with the Methodist Church. The Methodist movement of the eighteenth century was generally opposed to slavery and promoted gender and racial equality, but when African Americans were accepted into Methodist Episcopal congregations, they were not treated equally. For example, African American men were able to "become" licensed preachers, but rarely preached and were not invited to formal meetings. And, as with many churches at that time, African Americans could not sit with the congregation, but were required to sit in galleries.<br><br>In the nineteenth century, prominent African American abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman joined the A.M.E. movement, strengthening calls for racial equality. In the twentieth century, the Cross Street congregation participated in the civil rights protests and marches of the 1960s and one of the church's preachers, Reverend William Davage, founded the Greater Middletown Negro Youth Scholarship Fund to help black students go to college. To this day, the church continues to be active in community outreach and social justice work.

Venture Smith Gravesite<br><br>

Venture Smith was a Connecticut slave who was eventually able to purchase his freedom and that of his family. The narrative he composed of his life is a rare and insightful look at the institution of slavery through the words of someone who experienced it firsthand.<br><br>By his own account, Venture Smith was born around 1730 in West Africa to a regional king and was given the name Broteer. In his youth, his village was raided and his father was murdered by a rival group. He was then captured and marched to a slave-trading port in Ghana where he was purchased by a ship captain bound for Newport.<br><br>Aboard this ship, he was given the name "Venture." Most of the Africans who accompanied him were sold in the Caribbean but Venture was brought to Newport and then to Connecticut where he was to work as a slave, presumably for the rest of his life.<br><br>Throughout his time as a slave, Venture's life was a testament to the brutality of slavery. One of his owners beat him severely for intervening in a fight between the owner and his wife. During the beating, the owner took all the money Venture and his wife, Meg, had saved for the purpose of buying their freedom.<br><br>Later, when he had a different owner, Venture entered into a deal which allowed him to work, earn, and save his own money. This deal eventually enabled him to purchase his freedom and that of Meg and their children.<br><br>Once free, Venture dictated a pamphlet about his experiences that can be read in the book, Five Black Lives. Venture Smith is one of the few Africans or African Americans that left behind a surviving account of his experiences of enslavement and freedom in his own words.<br><br>The cemetery located next to the First Church contains the grave of Venture Smith. Meg is buried next to him, and nearby is the grave of one of his sons, Solomon, who served in the War of 1812. Venture's granddaughter, who died in 1902, is buried there as well.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/venture-smith-from-slavery-to-freedom/" target="_blank">More</a> on Venture Smith

David Ruggles Gravesite<br><br>

David Ruggles (1810-1849), born in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/norwich/" target="_blank">Norwich</a>, Connecticut, was a New York City bookseller, journalist, abolitionist, Underground Railroad conductor, and founding member of the Vigilance Committee, which fought against the kidnapping of free and fugitive African Americans who were then sold into slavery. Ruggles also served as a mentor to abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and William Cooper Nell.<br><br>Before joining the abolitionist movement, Ruggles worked as a mariner in New York and saved enough money to open a grocery store in 1828. The store also functioned as a library and reading room for African Americans (who were not permitted to use New York's public libraries). Ruggles's business was the first African American-owned bookstore in the country.<br><br>Beginning in the 1830s, Ruggles became very active in the New York abolitionist movement. Rather than simply espousing abolitionist beliefs, he practiced and advocated participation in activities to bring about the end of slavery. He engaged in civil disobedience and published several anti-slavery works, including his journal, The Mirror of Liberty--the first journal edited and published by an African American.<br><br>After about a decade of active and often dangerous abolitionist work, Ruggles fell ill and became nearly blind. He relocated to Florence, Massachusetts, to live among a community of abolitionists and he eventually regained some of his sight. Ruggles remained engaged in anti-slavery activity until his death in 1849.<br><br>Currently, The David Ruggles Center, a museum and historical center dedicated to David Ruggles, is located in Florence, Massachusetts. David Ruggles's gravesite is located at Yantic Cemetery at Lafayette and Williams Streets in Norwich.

Joshua Hempsted House<br><br>

Joshua Hempsted was a farmer, surveyor, carpenter, gravestone cutter, and famous New England diarist, <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/joshua-hempsted-born-in-new-london/" target="_blank">born</a> on September 1, 1678, in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a>, Connecticut. Hempsted began keeping a diary on September 8, 1711, and continued it for almost 50 years, providing one of the richest historical resources known to exist about life in early New England.<br><br>He was born and raised in New London at 11 Hempsted Street (in a house built by his grandfather) and lived there with his parents and seven sisters. As a husband and father, he shared the house with his wife and their nine children. Later in his life, Hempsted shared the house with an enslaved man named Adam Jackson, some of Jackson's children, and two grandsons whom he raised.<br><br>By the nineteenth century, many in the Hempsted family were staunch abolitionists and the house became a stop on the Underground Railroad. It also housed a small school and among its students were several African American children.<br><br>In the mid-nineteenth century, George Fayerweather (a Native American and African American blacksmith) and his wife, Sarah Harris (the first person of color to be admitted to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/prudence-crandall-fights-for-equal-access-to-education/" target="_blank">Prudence Crandall's school</a> in Canterbury) lived in a home close to Hempsted. They were both very active abolitionists.<br><br>During the same time period, Savillion Haley, another abolitionist, built homes in the area on former Hempsted property and sold them to free black families at cost. Other African Americans soon arrived, forming an important early free African American community.<br><br>The Hempsted family occupied the house until 1937.<br><br>The 1678 Joshua Hempsted House, owned by <a href="https://www.ctlandmarks.org/" target="_blank">Connecticut Landmarks</a>, is open to the public and contains a family archive of early abolitionist papers.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/joshua-hempsted-diary-a-window-into-colonial-connecticut/" target="_blank">More</a> on Joshua Hempsted<br><br><a href="https://www.ctlandmarks.org/hempsted" target="_blank">Visit</a> the Joshua Hempsted House

Flora Hercules Gravesite<br><br>

The headstone of Flora Hercules (located at the Antientist Burial Ground, Near Hempstead and Granite Streets in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a>)lists her as the wife of Hercules, "Governor of the Negroes." The inscription not only offers evidence of pervasive slavery in Connecticut during the eighteenth century, but also of a unique custom enslaved African Americans employed to help preserve their culture--that of "<a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticuts-black-governors/" target="_blank">Black Governors</a>."<br><br>Across New England in the mid-eighteenth century, African Americans held "elections" that were a combination of West African and American ceremony and were known as 'Lection Days for "Negro Governors" and "Kings." During these ceremonies, African Americans gathered unsupervised to elect a leader for their community. Slave owners are said to have vied to have the best dressed slaves and provided clothing, jewelry, wigs, horses, and carriages because having a "governor" or "king" for a slave may have afforded the owner a certain amount of prestige among slave-owners. The ability to speak an African language, being a descendant of African royalty, being able to state one's lineage, and other African-based criteria, accounted for an enslaved person's status in such elections.<br><br>These early ceremonies served to create a foundation for subsequent African American institutions and created a group of individuals within the community who were held in high esteem. By 1755, "Negro Elections" upheld a uniquely African American social structure. Though regarded by the "master class" as humorous, highly imitative, and unthreatening to the status quo; for African Americans the elections represented continuity of African practice and identity as well as resistance.<br><br>'Lection Day gave African Americans, who were dispersed among different homes and farms, a sense of community and bolstered communication networks that spread news and information throughout the African American population. The festivals also educated children and adults who had no direct knowledge of Africa, by reinforcing proper speech, decorum and demeanor, and the preservation of African culture. The disappearance of Negro Elections around New England coincided with gradual emancipation.

Connecticut 29th Colored Regiment Monument<br><br>

Criscuolo Park was a very different place in 1863 than it is today. In the fall of that year, in the midst of the <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/civil-war/" target="_blank">Civil War</a>, the first all-black regiment in Connecticut (<a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-29th-regiment-connecticut-volunteers-fought-more-than-one-war/" target="_blank">the 29th Regiment of Connecticut Volunteers</a>) mustered and trained to fight for their country on these grounds.<br><br>The more than nine hundred black recruits of the 29th endured racism and discrimination throughout their service. They received lower pay than white troops and were often ordered to serve in the back of the corps.<br><br>They embarked from Connecticut in March of 1864 for training and camped in South Carolina at Hilton Head. In August they came under fire for the first time, fighting bravely as they successfully deterred several rebel attacks. Later, the men of <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-29th-first-to-enter-confederate-capital-when-it-surrenders-today-in-history/" target="_blank">the 29th became the first infantry to enter the Confederate capital</a> of Richmond, Virginia.<br><br>Upon their return home to Connecticut, and after suffering many losses in their fight against slavery, the men of the 29th Colored Regiment found it would still be many years before African Americans in Connecticut would gain their equality before the law. They were told by the governor, "Connecticut now denies you privileges which it grants to others, for no other apparent reason than because God has made you to differ in complexion, yet justice will not always stand afar off. Be patient."<br><br>Dedicated in 2008, the monument at Criscuolo Park commemorates the soldiers of the Connecticut 29th Colored Regiment C.V. Infantry. The memorial was designed by sculptor Ed Hamilton, who also created the Amistad Memorial in downtown <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a>.<br><br><a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticuts-black-civil-war-regiment/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Connecticut 29th Colored Regiment

Freedom Schooner Amistad<br><br>

The Freedom Schooner Amistad is a Baltimore Clipper that first launched on June 13, 2000, and is a replica of the original slave ship <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/the-amistad/" target="_blank">Amistad</a>. It operates today as a symbol of the human struggle for freedom, educating the public about the landmark anti-slavery case associated with its infamous namesake.<br><br>In the summer of 1839, the arrival of the slave ship Amistad to Connecticut resulted in a trial that was of great importance to the growing abolitionist movement throughout the United States. The Amistad mutiny took place on July 2, 1839, when fifty-three enslaved Mende Africans revolted and took control of the ship near Cuba. Nearly two months later, the Amistad was seized by the U.S. Navy near Long Island, New York, and brought to <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/" target="_blank">New London</a>, Connecticut. The Mende were held in a <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-haven/" target="_blank">New Haven</a> jail as a trial took place to determine whether they were guilty of mutiny and murder. Eventually, they were freed by the U.S. Supreme Court and permitted to return to West Africa.<br><br>The ship was constructed, in part, from planks cut from iroko trees donated by Sierra Leone (the original home of the mutineers and the country to which they returned). and not only educates and engages visitors on the history of the ship and the Amistad trial, but also engages them in the struggle against modern-day slavery and human trafficking.<br><br>When not traveling, the Freedom Schooner Amistad is docked at Long Wharf in New Haven.<br><br><a href="https://discoveringamistad.org/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Freedom Schooner Amistad

Mary and Eliza Freeman Houses & Walters Zion Church<br><br>

The Mary and Eliza Freeman Houses (circa 1848) in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/bridgeport/" target="_blank">Bridgeport</a>, CT are rare and irreplaceable evidence of African American life prior to Emancipation.<br><br>Although it is often a "hidden history," free communities of color existed throughout New England in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. One such community Bridgeport's "Liberia"--first referred to as Ethiope in the 19th century and then "Little Liberia" in the 20th century--began to develop on empty land south of Bridgeport proper in 1821.<br><br>Little Liberia attracted free African Americans, Native Americans, runaway enslaved people, and Black settlers from the Caribbean and other places bordering the Atlantic Ocean. It was a successful community which established churches, schools, businesses, Bridgeport's first free lending library, a luxury hotel for wealthy Blacks, and social organizations. It was also an Underground Railroad destination settlement.<br><br>Mary and Eliza were the sisters of one of Little Liberia's founders, Joel Freeman. They moved to Bridgeport from <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/derby/" target="_blank">Derby</a>, purchasing adjacent lots in 1848 to construct their homes and were accomplished business women. (When Mary Freeman died, the only Bridgeporter of greater wealth was legendary showman PT Barnum.)<br><br>Community leader Joel Freeman moved to Bridgeport from Derby in 1828. Freeman, along with Peter and Grant Hawley founded Zion Church in 1828. The existing Walters AME Zion church, built in 1882, stands on its original 1835 foundation, making it the oldest surviving Black church building in Fairfield County.<br><br>The Freeman Houses were <a href="https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=3e335402-8cf8-425e-a76c-9409d3aa7960" target="_blank">placed on the National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1999. <a href="https://freemancenterbpt.com/" target="_blank">The Mary and Eliza Freeman Center for History and Community</a>, established in 2009, took ownership of the vacant homes in 2010. In June of 2018, the houses, which are an important reminder of the presence of free African Americans during slavery, were placed on the list of "America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.<br><br><a href="https://freemancenterbpt.com/" target="_blank">More</a> on the Mary and Eliza Freeman Houses
