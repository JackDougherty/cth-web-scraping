One year later, she became a pioneer in African American education and abolitionism when she admitted Sarah Harris (1815-1879), the daughter of a prosperous African American farmer, who had completed the district school and wished to be trained as a teacher. Angry community residents demanded that Harris be removed, but Crandall refused to comply and instead shutdown her school and opened a new one exclusively for teaching African American girls.<br><br>Crandall began to recruit pupils among middle-class African American families throughout the Northeast. Her steadfast commitment to the education of these young women was immediately tested by withering opposition from Connecticut residents who refused to tolerate a school for young women of color. Despite this hateful reaction, Crandall continued to operate the school.<br><br>In response, the state of Connecticut eventually passed the "Black Law," which barred the teaching of "any colored people. . . not inhabitants" of Connecticut without a town's permission. Crandall was arrested for breaking this law, spent a night in jail, and faced three trials. Her case eventually became a cause célèbre throughout the country.<br><br>Crandall's first trial resulted in no verdict, but in the second she was convicted. A third trial, which was an appeal before Connecticut's Supreme Court, overturned the conviction and dismissed the case altogether. Arguments from her trials were later used in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/347/483" target="_blank">Brown v. Board of Education</a>, the Supreme Court's landmark school desegregation decision of 1954.<br><br>The Prudence Crandall Museum in Canterbury, Connecticut, celebrates her legacy and is a site on both the <a href="https://www.ctvisit.com/listings/connecticut-womens-heritage-trail" target="_blank">Connecticut Women's Heritage Trail</a> and the <a href="http://www.ctfreedomtrail.org/" target="_blank">Connecticut Freedom Trail</a>.
